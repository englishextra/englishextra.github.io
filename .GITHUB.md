# Recreating the repo with gh-pages branch

## Backup files

Get current code remotely:

    git clone https://github.com/englishextra/englishextra.github.io.git

Or do it manually on your local machine by copying files to temporary folder.

## Clean the repo

    cd englishextra.github.io

    git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    # Creates our branch, without any parents (it's an orphan!)
    # Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'

    git rm -rf .
    # Remove all files from the old working tree

    # Now remove all files manully
    # rm '.gitignore'

    # You should have gh-pages orphan branch so that your site will appear
    echo "My GitHub Page" > index.html
    git add index.html
    git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
    git push origin gh-pages -f

    # Delete the branch
    git branch -D master

    # Rename the current branch to master
    git branch -m master

    # Now add files manually

    # add files
    git add .

    # Finally, force update your repository
    git push -f origin master

    # Commit changes
    git commit -m "Added files"

    # Push changes to origin
    git push --progress "origin" master

**Switch to master branch and add the rest of the content and commit to master and push to origin**

## Remove all history, keep the code in current state

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13716658/how-to-delete-all-commit-history-in-github>

Deleting the `.git` folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

    # Checkout
    git checkout --orphan latest_branch

    # Add all the files
    git add -A

    # Commit the changes
    git commit -am "commit message"

    # Delete the branch
    git branch -D master

    # Rename the current branch to master
    git branch -m master

    # Finally, force update your repository
    git push -f origin master

PS: this will not keep your old commit history around :)
