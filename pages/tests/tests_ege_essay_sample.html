								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a1">Some people say that fast food has a bad effect on our health</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Fast food restaurants like McDonald&#8217;s serve millions of people in more than 100&#160;countries each day. Fast&#160;food is very popular, especially among teenagers. Nevertheless, is such food healthy or should we avoid&#160;it?</p><p>In my opinion, fast food does much harm to people&#8217;s health. Firstly, such food is low in protein, vitamins and minerals. Secondly, fast food contains a lot of cholesterol. Cholesterol causes the production of a fatty plaque that clogs the arteries, which can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Thirdly, fast food is high in fat, sugar and calories and full of chemical additives. For&#160;example, a can of Coke contains about eight teaspoons of sugar and artificial sweeteners. People who are used to consuming several cans a day may suffer from diabetes, cancer and tooth&#160;decay.</p><p>On the contrary, many people like fast food because it is tasty, cheap and ubiquitous. Besides, fast food can be prepared and served very quickly, so going to fast food restaurants helps to save time and&#160;money.</p><p>However, I&#160;still believe that we should avoid &#8216;junk&#8217; food because those who like it are facing a serious problem threatening their health. They&#160;may become overweight or obese, which can lead to heart disorders and other health problems.</p><p>To sum up, the food choices we make every day affect our health. We&#160;should avoid food that is rich in cholesterol, added sugars, salt, and saturated fats. If&#160;we want to stay healthy and to be in good shape, we should choose healthy, balanced and well-apportioned&#160;meals.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a2">Some people say that genetically modified food is hazardous to health</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Genetically modified foods have caused a lot of debate, scientific discussion, and media coverage. Some&#160;people say that GM foods have many benefits, however, there are ecological and human health concerns connected with GM foods. Are&#160;they safe or harmful to humans?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;believe that GM foods have several benefits. Firstly, producers of GM food say that it has a number of advantages in terms of price, durability, and nutritional value. Secondly, GM crops provide benefits to the environment through a reduction in the use of pesticides. In&#160;addition, the recent rapid increase in human population has raised concerns that we will not be able to provide everybody with food. People may need additional food supplies, so GM foods may help to solve the world hunger problems.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people prefer to avoid GM food. They&#160;say there is a possibility that GM foods may be harmful to humans. For&#160;example, introducing a gene into a plant may create a new allergen. Others fear that we may encounter new diseases.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that there is nothing to worry about. So&#160;far, there is no proof that GM foods are bad for your health. Besides, as GM crops are faster and cheaper to grow, it will be possible to increase production and lower the cost of&#160;food.</p><p>To conclude, scientists should continue studying possible side effects connected with the consumption of GM foods. I&#160;think all countries must require GMO labelling, as consumers should be free to choose whether to buy GM foods or not. Nonetheless, I&#160;feel that there is no risk to human health.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a3">Some people think that there are many benefits of being a vegetarian</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, being a vegetarian is rather popular. Some&#160;people say that they are thinking about becoming vegetarians because they want to become healthier and to live longer. However, do vegetarian diets really benefit your health?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;believe that vegetarianism is not for everyone. Firstly, meat is very high in protein, which your body needs in order to grow and remain strong and healthy. Secondly, vegetarians often suffer from weakening of bones and depression. In&#160;addition, it must be rather difficult to be a vegetarian because you have to make sure the food products you buy do not contain ingredients derived from the slaughter of animals or ingredients not suitable for&#160;you.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that it is cruel to eat animals. Apart from that, they say that a properly planned vegetarian diet is good for your health and helps to prevent certain diseases. Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre and antioxidants.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that people, especially children and teenagers, should eat meat and fish because they are nourishing and contain vitamins that make us stronger. What&#160;is more, many fruit and vegetables are harmful because they are full of pesticides.</p><p>To sum up, it is up to you to decide whether to become a vegetarian or not. You&#160;should choose a diet that suits your personal health needs and body type. I&#160;think that a diet that contains a sufficient amount of vitamins, minerals, and protein is better for your health.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a4">Some people think that organic food is healthier than conventional food</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The organic food market is growing rapidly. Many&#160;people are willing to pay more for organic food. However, is it really worth the extra&#160;cost?</p><p>To my mind, buying organic food is a waste of your money. Firstly, organic products cost 10&#160;to 40% more than similar conventionally produced products. Secondly, there is no significant difference between organic and conventionally grown food in terms of safety and nutritional value. What&#160;is more, you cannot even taste the difference.</p><p>Nevertheless, a lot of people choose to buy organic food for various reasons. First of all, organic foods are produced without using synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers. They&#160;do not contain neither chemical food additives nor genetically modified organisms. Secondly, some people believe that organic farming is less damaging to the environment. Organic farms use less energy and produce less&#160;waste.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;cannot agree with the second point of view. I&#160;think that organic pesticides are as damaging to the environment as synthetic pesticides. In&#160;addition, the increased land needed to farm organic food could destroy the rain forest and wipe out many ecosystems in the future.</p><p>To sum up, people should remember that the food choices they make every day affect their health. Like&#160;any product, organic foods have both advantages and disadvantages; that is why it is important to weigh up all the pros and cons. Personally, I&#160;believe that organic food will hardly make us healthier, so there is probably no sense in buying&#160;it.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a5">Some people believe that the only way to lose weight is following a weight loss diet</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>New weight loss diets are constantly coming out. Those who are overweight or obese often follow weight loss diets, but they know very little about the possible consequences. The&#160;question arises whether weight loss diets are really effective and good for your health.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that weight loss diets can damage your health. Firstly, they make it hard to get the daily requirements of vitamins, minerals, and protein. Secondly, weight loss diets can cause fatigue and weaken the body's immune system. What&#160;is more, dieting can result in such eating disorders as anorexia or bulimia.</p><p>However, some people lower their caloric intake in order to get thinner. They&#160;are convinced that it is possible to lose weight without going to the gym. Others are afraid that they may suffer different injuries while exercising.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that if you exercise regularly, you can eat whatever you want because you are burning it all off. There will be no need to reduce the amount of food you eat, and you will be in good shape and stay healthy.</p><p>To sum up, it is well known that carrying extra weight is dangerous because it puts people at risk of developing many diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Nevertheless, not all weight loss diets are good, and only some of them are the right ones for your personal health needs and body type. I&#160;believe that healthy weight loss results from both diet and exercise.</p> </div>

Some&#160;people are too tired to prepare home-cooked meals at the end of a long, busy day, so they choose to eat out. However, is it really a good idea to eat in a restaurant instead of at&#160;home?</p><p>I think there are many advantages of dining out. Firstly, at a restaurant you can try a variety of dishes that are difficult to prepare at home. Secondly, restaurants can introduce people to different cultures through food, music and decor. Thirdly, a restaurant is a good place for dates and business deals. A&#160;lot of people go to restaurants to celebrate special occasions, to get away from household chores and to focus on communication with family and friends.</p><p>On the contrary, some people say that the healthiest meals are those that are cooked at home because they contain less salt and fat than restaurant food. Those who eat at home spend more time with their family members, which encourages family bonding. In&#160;addition, eating out can make a big hole in your savings.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that when people dine at home, they often eat quickly in order to return to their household chores or work. Eating out gives a family the chance to prolong the dinner hour and spend more time together. Besides, many restaurants today offer healthier food choices.</p><p>To conclude, eating at home is a challenge if a person has a very busy schedule. It&#160;may be healthier and less expensive to cook your own meals. Nevertheless, dining out is a real pleasure with a wide and tempting choice of menus and venues at affordable prices.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a8">Some people believe that it is important to look nice and to follow fashion</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Fashion has a profound impact on society. Many&#160;people pay much attention to what they wear. However, is it so important to look stylish?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that everyone should be pleasant to look at. First of all, it is well known that people are instinctively attracted to those who are well-dressed&#160;and</p><p>good-looking. For&#160;example, teenagers who wear trendy clothes are more likely to become popular among their peers. Some&#160;young people are convinced that wearing designer labels helps them gain the admiration of their peers and find new friends. Secondly, beautiful and stylish clothes make us feel self-confident. What&#160;is more, well-dressed people have more chances to find a good job or to get a promotion.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people do not pay much attention to their appearance. They&#160;say that it is not important what you look like or what you wear. What&#160;really matters is a person&#8217;s inner qualities. Besides, keeping up with fashion is very expensive. Many&#160;people cannot afford to spend much money on trendy and designer clothes.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that when it comes to first impressions, appearance and clothes are very important. Right or wrong, what is on the outside sometimes matters as much as what is inside.</p><p>To sum up, we often judge people by their looks. That&#160;is why if you want to make the right first impression, you should look nice. No&#160;matter how kind and intelligent you are, your physical appearance and clothes are still very important.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a9">Some people think that clothes help them show who they really are</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>People wear clothes to protect their body from extreme weather, insects, chemicals, and other hazards. However, the things that we wear also serve to attract attention and to express our individuality. Does&#160;it mean that we should pay more attention to our clothes?</p><p>In my opinion, your clothes can make you different from other people. Firstly, the things that we wear help us show our feelings and ideas about life. For&#160;example, what young people wear is often connected with the music they listen to and their views on politics and social issues. Secondly, your clothes can tell other people much about your character and your attitude to yourself and those around you. For&#160;instance, those who like neutral colours do not like to stand out from the crowd and prefer to blend in with other people. Additionally, a single item of clothing can declare a person&#8217;s occupation, social class or ethnic and religious affiliations.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that those who try to keep up with the latest fashions look exactly like everyone else instead of being who they really are. What&#160;is more, a person&#8217;s clothes may send the wrong message.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that clothes give us much room for self-expression and help to form the perception people have of us. If&#160;you are well dressed, you can command instant respect and attention..</p><p>To conclude, you should choose your clothes according to your tastes, preferences and character. No&#160;matter where you are, your clothes send a message about you. That&#160;is why it is important to pay attention to what you look like and what you&#160;wear.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a10">Some people think that schoolchildren should wear school uniforms</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>An increasing number of schools are adopting a school uniform policy. Though the idea of uniforms seems relatively simple, a uniform programme causes controversy. Does&#160;that mean that schoolchildren should continue wearing regular clothes&#160;then?</p><p>To my mind, wearing a school uniform has many benefits. Firstly, some teenagers wear clothes that are not appropriate at school such as short skirts or T-shirts with vulgar language. Secondly, those who ignore fashion rules set by their peers can be the victims of bullying at school when there is no dress code. School uniforms make all students look the same, regardless of social class or financial situation. Furthermore, a mandatory school</p><p>uniform policy helps to increase students' self-esteem and promotes a feeling of community spirit within a school.</p><p>However, some people are adamantly against uniforms in schools. Some&#160;schoolchildren are convinced that school uniforms violate their freedom of expression and their right to wear clothing that they consider comfortable and attractive. Apart from that, uniforms can be quite expensive for many families.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that your unique gifts and personality traits go deeper than your clothes. I&#160;do not think that school uniforms are going to hide who you really are. In&#160;addition, some parents cannot afford to buy expensive clothes for their children, so school uniforms can prove to be a cheaper way of dressing schoolchildren.</p><p>To sum up, the benefits of school uniforms should not be discounted. They&#160;give students a sense of belonging to an institution, and respect for teachers&#8217; increases, and attendance levels improve as a result. I&#160;think that all schools must have dress&#160;codes.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a11">Some people say that there should not be any rules about the clothes people can wear in the workplace</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The first thing people notice about employees is how they look. Some&#160;companies have dress codes, while others do not have set rules for their employees. However, do people really need any rules governing what they should wear in the workplace?</p><p>In my opinion, there are many benefits of implementing a dress code policy. Firstly, dress codes eliminate inappropriate clothes such as ripped jeans, sweatpants or flip-flops. Having a dress code allows employees to understand what acceptable business attire is. Secondly, having a clearly defined dress code gives an air of professionalism to an organization. Thirdly, employees are more likely to feel that they are part of a team when they follow a dress&#160;code.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people complain that they are not allowed to dress as they please in the workplace. They&#160;say that a business formal dress code does not enable them to experiment with prints and colours. Apart from that, it is not easy to choose clothes and accessories that are tasteful and work-appropriate.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that dress codes do not prevent employees from maintaining their own style. Dress codes just show them the parameters in which they must fit. Besides, some companies set aside days when workers are allowed to wear casual clothes.</p><p>To conclude, you have to create a professional image if you want to tell your employer that you take your job seriously. Companies create dress codes to ensure their employees are dressed appropriately, to maintain a proper company image and to prevent distractions in the workplace. I&#160;believe that unprofessional dress may reflect poorly on a person&#8217;s career.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a12">Some people say that wearing fur is unacceptable</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>In the past, people had to wear fur to survive as it insulated their bodies against the cold while they were hunting for food or looking for shelter. Today, many people like fur because it is luxurious and warm; however, others consider buying and selling furs morally reprehensible. The&#160;question arises whether it is ethical to wear&#160;furs.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;object to wearing real furs. First and foremost, I&#160;believe that a fur coat represents the cruelty to defenceless animals. Millions of foxes, rabbits, minks, beavers, and chinchillas are confined in cages and then killed on fur farms. Secondly, fur coats, hats and shawls are very expensive. Besides, the cost of maintenance is rather high. You&#160;will have to take your fur coat to a professional fur cleaner once a year, regardless of whether it is worn or stored in your closet.</p><p>Nevertheless, many people choose to buy fur coats and hats. For&#160;some of them wearing furs is a way to show their opulence. Having a fur coat is a symbol of wealth and success.</p><p>Others say that nothing feels like real fur, and nothing really keeps you as&#160;warm.</p><p>Anyway, there are a lot of expensive-looking fake furs in numerous shops. These days, we do not have to wear fur to stay warm and to look stylish.</p><p>To sum up, if people were educated about the way in which animals are treated and then killed to make a fur coat, they would probably no longer want one. We&#160;should remember</p><p>that there are many alternatives to fur. I&#160;would prefer showing compassion for animals to wearing a &#8216;status symbol&#8217;.</p> </div>

Some&#160;people proudly display their tattoos and piercings, while others say that they are repelling. Is&#160;it a good idea to have your body pierced or to get a picture that is permanently marked on your&#160;skin?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;am against tattoos and body piercings. Firstly, I&#160;think that they do not make people more beautiful. Secondly, doctors warn people about possible dangers of tattooing and piercing, including bacterial infection and allergic reactions. These procedures are painful and risky. In&#160;addition, most employers do not want their employees to have tattoos and piercings because it gives them an air of unprofessionalism.</p><p>However, some young people say that their tattoos and piercings make them feel attractive and give them an opportunity to show their individuality and to stand out from the crowd. Tattooing and piercing allow young people to express themselves creatively. Others get tattooed to mark important events in their&#160;lives.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that most tattoos and body piercings are unattractive. Besides, no matter how much you like your new tattoo or piercing, you may have a change of heart a few years later or straight away. Nevertheless, tattoos are permanent, and removing them often leaves unsightly&#160;scars.</p><p>To conclude, those who want a tattoo or a body piercing should think about all the risks involved. You&#160;may admire the huge dragon on your back, but other people may dislike it. If&#160;you want to improve your job prospects and to stay healthy, you would better leave your body unadorned.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a15">Some people think that tourism ruins everything that it touches</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Tourism has taken off in recent years. Some&#160;people think that tourism has many benefits, while others say that it causes a load of problems. Is&#160;tourism a blessing or a&#160;curse?</p><p>I believe that tourism is extremely beneficial. Firstly, it brings profit to the local and regional areas and creates jobs at the local, state and government levels. Secondly, local festivals and cultural events have been developed and supported because of heavy tourist participation, and many buildings and monuments have been renovated. What&#160;is more, experiencing different cultures is interesting and educational for tourists.</p><p>However, some people are not optimistic about tourism. They&#160;say that some beaches and resorts are uncomfortably crowded, and the historic centres of world-famous cities are becoming occupied by thousands of tourists. Besides, tourism can disrupt ecosystems and environments. For&#160;example, a lot of beaches and lagoons are being destroyed to make room for hotels and restaurants.</p><p>Nevertheless, today more and more people are becoming interested in ecotourism, which promotes recycling, energy efficiency, water conservation, and the safe disposal of waste and garbage. Therefore, tourism can provide an impetus for the conservation of pristine areas otherwise vulnerable to industrial development.</p><p>To conclude, tourism should be responsible, and it should promote knowledge and understanding. Tourists must respect local cultures and try to minimize the negative influence of tourism on the environment. I&#160;think that the problems caused by tourism can be solved if we make every effort to preserve our environment.</p> </div>

They&#160;can be fun for both teachers and students, but school trips have some disadvantages and may involve some risk, too. Do&#160;school trips really help students to learn and to understand the real&#160;world?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that school trips are very interesting and educational. Firstly, school trips give students a chance to acquire new information, to improve their knowledge, to apply different skills and to gain new insight into various subjects. Secondly, school trips break up the monotony of the classroom routine and enable students to see how their classwork applies to everyday life. What&#160;is more, school trips put schoolchildren in real-life scenarios and require observation, investigation, and communication with other people.</p><p>However, some people are against school trips. Some&#160;parents and teachers are afraid that they might deal with emergencies, or that schoolchildren might suffer some&#160;harm.</p><p>Apart from that, school trips are often expensive and difficult to organize.</p><p>Nevertheless, statistics show that school trips are usually safe for students because the school takes measures to minimize the possibility of anything going wrong. Besides, some school trips do not cost parents a&#160;penny.</p><p>To sum up, a school trip is a good way to support a student's classroom learning experience. Educational trips allow schoolchildren to apply what they have learned at school to real-world situations and enable teachers to keep their students educated and entertained. I&#160;believe that there is no better way to create memorable learning experiences, to foster team building and to motivate students to acquire knowledge.</p> </div>

It&#160;gives tourists a chance to learn about the area that they visit in a way that will not damage the environment. However, is ecotourism as beneficial to the environment and local communities as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>I think that there are many reasons to promote ecotourism. Firstly, the main aims of ecotourism are recycling, energy efficiency, water conservation, and the safe disposal of waste and garbage. Secondly, ecotourism contributes to the economic development of local communities. Tourists provide local people with work, use local transportation, inns&#160;and</p><p>markets, and make voluntary contributions. In&#160;addition, funds generated from ecotourism are used to establish and maintain national parks and nature reserves.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that ecotourism does have some disadvantages. Firstly, the increasing number of tourists can lead to the expansion of infrastructure. As&#160;a result, many parts of the natural environment may be destroyed to make room for commercial tourist structures. What&#160;is more, native people are often exploited for cheap labour.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that ecotourism can provide an impetus for the conservation of pristine areas. It&#160;teaches tourists to respect local cultures and to travel with little impact on the environment. Besides, local resorts can build properties that will not harm the indigenous flora and&#160;fauna.</p><p>To conclude, ecotourism gives people a chance to enjoy the natural wonders of the environment and to experience new culture and traditions. It&#160;aims at conserving the environment, teaching tourists to reduce their negative impact on ecosystems and improving the well-being of local people. I&#160;think ecotourism brings worldwide awareness to endangered species and pristine locations.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a18">Some people think that the best way to travel in a town or in a city is on foot</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, we use cars and public transport to travel faster. As&#160;a result, we walk very little and spend less time travelling. Nevertheless, does it mean that we need not use our legs anymore?</p><p>In my opinion, the best way to view and discover most towns and cities is on&#160;foot.</p><p>Firstly, when you travel on foot, you can see much more on your way. You&#160;can stop wherever you want and drop into a cafe or a shop. Secondly, travelling on foot is by far the cheapest mode of transportation and sometimes even the fastest because walking allows you to avoid traffic jams. What&#160;is more, walking is an excellent physical exercise that strengthens the immune system.</p><p>However, some people are against travelling on foot. Firstly, the weather can change from sunny to rainy, and if you have left your umbrella at home, you will get soaked to the skin and may catch a cold. Apart from that, while travelling in big cities, you may be attacked by muggers or get run over by a&#160;car.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that if you take time to plan your routes and put everything you may need into your backpack, you will certainly enjoy your walking tour. Besides, tourists must be careful when crossing roads and keep their valuables in a safe&#160;place.</p><p>To sum up, travelling on foot is much healthier than travelling by car or by bus.

Some&#160;people say that travelling by car is very convenient, while others think that driving a car has many disadvantages. The&#160;question arises whether cars have changed our lives for the better or for the&#160;worse.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;cannot imagine our lives without cars. First and foremost, cars give people personal independence. They&#160;allow them to travel at their own convenience without having to rely on public transport. Secondly, car-owners can avoid crowds and reduce travel time. What&#160;is more, having a car gives you a sense of stability and financial security.</p><p>However, some people say that we could be better off without cars. One&#160;of the major disadvantages of driving a car is traffic, which can make you late for important events and business meetings. Furthermore, cars are more dangerous them other means of transport, and thousands of people die in car crashes each&#160;year.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that people who walk or bike are at a greater risk of everything from getting robbed to being run over by a vehicle. When&#160;you are in a car, you do not have to worry about the weather or being attacked by others.</p><p>To sum up, driving a car is a convenient and fast way of getting from one place&#160;to</p><p>another. If&#160;you have your own car, you are not dependent on walking, biking, asking others to give you a ride, and taking cabs or public transport.

Many&#160;people say that air travel has a lot of advantages in terms of time and quality. Nevertheless, is it really the best option for travellers?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;like travelling by plane. Firstly, it is the fastest way to get anywhere. Air&#160;travel helps me to save plenty of time and gives me an opportunity to visit out-of-the-way parts of the world. Secondly, travelling by plane is enjoyable and comfortable. I&#160;can use travel time to look through the porthole, to listen to music, to read a book or to take a nap. In&#160;addition, travel tickets are easy to book online.</p><p>Anyway, some people say that air travel has a number of disadvantages. Firstly, it always takes much time to get to the airport, to check in, to have your baggage weighed and to board. Secondly, travelling by air is often more expensive than travelling by other means of transport. In&#160;addition, some people doubt that travelling by plane is&#160;safe.</p><p>However, in fact flying remains among the safest forms of travel. It&#160;is well known that the number of fatalities caused by road or rail accidents is much higher than that of airlines. Besides, air travel is no longer a luxury because of the reduced&#160;costs.</p><p>To conclude, airplanes enable people to travel across the world in a matter of hours.

There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages when it comes to taking the bus or train to work or school. Is&#160;public transportation a blessing or a&#160;curse?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;do not like public transportation for a number of reasons. First of all, buses and trains can be overcrowded, especially during rush hour. Secondly, you always have to design your schedule around that of the bus or train. What&#160;is more, buses may not always go to specific locations on small streets. Sometimes I&#160;need a secondary source of transportation or have to walk some distance to arrive at my final destination.</p><p>However, some people say there are good reasons to use public transportation. Firstly, it is cheaper than driving and maintaining your own car. Secondly, people can use the commute time to work or relax. In&#160;addition, using public transportation instead of driving a car is less damaging to the environment as it helps to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>Anyway, beside buses, there are still thousands of cars on the road. They&#160;emit exhaust simultaneously and cause traffic. Besides, I&#160;do not think it is easy to relax in a filthy bus or train that is packed with angry commuters.</p><p>To sum up, most cities need to improve their public transportation.

The&#160;question arises whether hitchhiking is a dangerous adventure or a good way to reduce your road expenses.</p><p>In my opinion, hitchhiking is very risky. Firstly, you have to ride with total strangers. There have been cases of hitchhikers being attacked or killed. Besides, hitchhikers may end up in a deserted or unfamiliar area. Secondly, those who stand too close to the road may become victims of a car accident. Another disadvantage of hitchhiking is that you may&#160;spend</p><p>hours standing on the roadside and watching cars pass you&#160;by.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that hitchhiking is a good way to reduce road expenses. It&#160;is also for people who do not own a vehicle and cannot get a ride from a friend or relative. In&#160;addition, hitchhiking gives travellers a chance to meet new people and to make friends.</p><p>Anyway, in some countries drivers expect hitchhikers to pay them for the ride. Besides, there is a possibility that you may meet a bad person or lose valuable belongings.</p><p>Hitchhiking can lead to kidnapping, robbery, rape or murder.</p><p>To sum up, hitchhiking is more affordable than any other form of travel.

Firstly, in exotic countries you are more susceptible to different diseases. Secondly, a great number of tourists feel ill at ease because they do not understand a country&#8217;s language. Besides, travelling to exotic counties is rather expensive.</p><p>Anyway, those travelling to exotic countries should be vaccinated to lessen their chances of contracting serious diseases.

Besides, if you travel to exotic destinations during the off-season, you will be able to reduce your expenses.</p><p>To conclude, travelling to exotic countries can be very rewarding.

Secondly, travelling to foreign countries is an ideal opportunity to begin to learn a new language.</p><p>Additionally, international travel helps you to gain a new perspective on life and yourself.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that international travel is often associated with some problems and risks. Firstly, those who are going abroad will have to obtain a passport and apply for a tourist visa, which may take several weeks to get. Secondly, travelling abroad is rather expensive.

While you are not driving, you have time to do other things. For&#160;example, you can walk around, look through the windows, sleep, read or socialize with your fellow-passengers. Secondly, you do not have to deal with bad weather, heavy traffic, turbulence or jet lag. What&#160;is more, as trains are electrically powered, they are less harmful to the environment than other forms of transport.</p><p>However, some people say that they do not like travelling by train. Firstly, they always have to stand in a queue for a long time to buy train tickets. Secondly, when you travel by train, you cannot stop where you want. Finally, travelling by train is not very convenient if the trip is&#160;long.</p><p>Of course travelling by train is not as fast as travelling by plane, but it is the only option for those who do not like to fly. Besides, high-speed trains can run more than 200&#160;km/h. In&#160;addition, you can book travel tickets online.</p><p>To conclude, train travel will continue to attract passengers because it is fast, comfortable and safe. Travelling by train gives you a chance to enjoy beautiful scenery and to find out more about the places you are visiting. I&#160;believe that train travel may be the best option for passengers.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a26">Some people say that the best way to travel is by ship</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Travelling is an exciting adventure, which can become even more thrilling if you travel by ship. Some&#160;people say that travelling by ship has many advantages. However, is it the best option for passengers?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;like travelling by ship. Firstly, the ship stops in different ports and you can go on the shore for excursions, which allows you to see more places than just your final destination. Secondly, when you travel by ship, you do not have to change different means of transport, and you will certainly avoid traffic jams. Thirdly, cruise ships provide food, drinks and entertainment for travellers. They&#160;can offer well-known celebrities, bands and performance artists.</p><p>Nevertheless, those who are interested in vacationing aboard a cruise ship are often worried about the cost. Other people say that a cruise ship may not allow you to explore destinations in depth because you often have limited time in the area that you would like to explore. In&#160;addition, many people suffer from seasickness when out on the&#160;water.</p><p>Anyway, if you drink a lot of water and do not sit in a cramped cabin, you can reduce the chances of getting seasick. Moreover, you should budget for your trip and book in advance in order to avoid any problems.</p><p>To sum up, while you are aboard the ship, you will have plenty of time for reading, writing, playing games and socializing with your friends and loved ones. Travelling by ship is fast and comfortable. I&#160;think it is the best way of travelling for those who want to enjoy getting to their destinations as much as being&#160;there.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a27">Some people choose to travel abroad to receive medical care</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>In the past, only rich people and celebrities went abroad to obtain health&#160;care.</p><p>Nonetheless, the average person can have many medical procedures done in other countries nowadays. However, are foreign hospitals worth the trip abroad?</p><p>To my mind, medical tourism has a number of advantages. Firstly, it can be cheaper to receive medical treatment in another country. Some&#160;countries offer first class service at half the price. Secondly, a lot of people go abroad in order to avoid long waiting periods. In&#160;such countries as the USA or Britain a person may wait for a certain medical procedure for a year or even longer. Nevertheless, in other countries patients can receive the needed treatment</p><p>immediately. Moreover, medical travel gives people an opportunity to do some sightseeing and to relax on the beach while they recover.</p><p>On the contrary, some people worry about the quality of health care they will receive in other countries. It&#160;can be difficult to determine whether your doctor is well qualified, and whether your hospital is a first-rate institution. Besides, exposure to foreign diseases can be a hazard to weakened patients. Moreover, holiday-related activities, such as sunbathing, swimming or sightseeing, may hinder the patient&#8217;s recovery.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that there are many excellent doctors and hospitals in foreign countries, and you may get better care if you go abroad.</p><p>To sum up, thousands of people benefit from medical tourism. The&#160;advantages include lower prices, first-rate care, less wait times, some post-operative rest and relaxation, and luxurious accommodations. If&#160;you take time to check whether the doctors, the hospital and the staff are first-rate, you can get excellent care abroad.</p> </div>

Some&#160;people say that they have hundreds of acquaintances, but creating and maintaining a true friendship may prove difficult. Do&#160;we really need friends and can we live without&#160;them?</p><p>I am convinced that we cannot live without friends. Firstly, friendship is very important for a person's emotional well-being. We&#160;give our time and energy to our friends because it brings us something in return: trust, support, intimacy, sympathy, and understanding. Secondly, you can talk to your friends about anything without fear of being judged. Thirdly, a true friend will help you if you are in poor health, if you have relationship or financial problems or just feel depressed.</p><p>However, some people think that friends can complicate their lives because you need time and energy to build and maintain friendships. Such&#160;people say that life without friends is easier and pain free. If&#160;you have no friends, you do not have to worry about hurting other people&#8217;s feelings or having fights. Besides, some people think that their friends may judge or criticize&#160;them.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that a true friend always accepts you as you are and never tries to change you. Those who have no friends feel lonely and isolated, which can cause stress and affect their physical health.</p><p>To conclude, it is stressful to live in the world of strangers. Friends give us a sense of being protected, emotional comfort, and moral support. Maintaining friendships takes time and effort, but a true friendship is worth of&#160;it.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a30">Some people think that you can have only one true friend</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Having friends is important for everyone. Some&#160;people may have hundreds of friends, while others have only one close friend. However, how many friends do we really&#160;need?</p><p>In my opinion, a person can have an infinite number of friends. The&#160;more friends you have, the happier you are. Firstly, your friends care about you and will offer to help any time of day or night. Secondly, your friends are always there when you need a shoulder to cry on. Moreover, if one of your friends is not contactable and you need somebody to talk to, you can call another friend, and he or she will rush to help&#160;you.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that it is better to have only one close friend. Having many friendships to maintain takes much time and energy. You&#160;have to schedule time for all your friends, remember their telephone numbers, birthdays and anniversaries and pay attention to what is going on in their lives. In&#160;addition, some people say that a true friend is someone who you know very well, so not everybody you socialize with can be called your friend.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that communicating with your friends and taking an interest in their lives is definitely not a waste of time because it brings us much in return.</p><p>To conclude, I&#160;doubt that a person can have close emotional ties with hundreds of people, but everybody can certainly have more than one true friend. As&#160;somebody once said, &#8216;Friends are like walls&#8217;. You&#160;can lean on them for support, and the more friends you have, the happier and more confident you&#160;are.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a31">Some people think that only those who have much in common can become friends</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people think that two individuals develop friendship if they have similar tastes, interests and life philosophies. However, many people find themselves drawn to those who have different perspectives and values. So, can opposites become friends?</p><p>I believe that opposites attract. Firstly, when we meet other people, we often look for qualities that we ourselves do not have, but that we wish we possessed. That&#160;is why we sometimes gravitate towards people who have completely different characters. Secondly, opposites often complement each other well. For&#160;example, a talkative person may like to communicate with a taciturn friend who can listen attentively. Moreover, if two people&#160;are</p><p>too much alike, their relationship may get boring.</p><p>Nevertheless, other people say that there must be activities that friends can share together. If&#160;you have the same interests as your friend, you will spend more time together and have a lot of things to discuss. On&#160;the contrary, if you do not share your friend&#8217;s interests, you may eventually grow apart. Besides, if two friends are complete opposites, they will have to work harder at building and maintaining their relationship than those who have much in common.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that similar tastes and interests do not guarantee that two individuals will become friends. Some&#160;people seem to have much in common, but they cannot or do not want to strike up a friendship.</p><p>To conclude, a friendship between opposites may be challenging, but many people are willing to accept the challenge. Some&#160;people appear to be incompatible on the surface, yet they find a way to build a close friendship. Those who are different from you can still become your friends.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a32">Some people think that nothing can ruin a true friendship</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Creating and maintaining friendships can be one of the most important things in life. However, there are friendships that last and those that end. Is&#160;there anything that can make true friends grow&#160;apart?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think nothing can make a true friendship end. Firstly, close friends always feel that they need each other. That&#160;is why they are afraid of losing their touch and do their best to maintain their friendship. Secondly, true friends are flexible about their friendship. When&#160;circumstances change, for example, one person gets married or has a baby, their relationship does not become less close. On&#160;the contrary, true friends try to spend more time together and to help each other. Furthermore, close friends accept the other person's foibles and&#160;flaws.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that there are many ways to ruin a friendship. Firstly, friends may have a few disagreements, which may lead to quarrels. If&#160;you say something cruel during a heated argument, it may hurt your friend&#8217;s feelings, and he or she may not want to forgive you. In&#160;addition, some people say that money often ruins friendships. If&#160;you get a well-paid job, your friend may envy you, which will put a strain on your relationship.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that true friends will never poison their friendship with&#160;envy.</p><p>Besides, a true friend will always forgive you for harsh words and will find a way to resolve conflicts.</p><p>To conclude, close friends will not drift away no matter what may happen. Instead, they will find new ways to stay close to each other. I&#160;think that a true friendship is strong enough to last forever.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a33">Many people think that love makes a person happy</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Love is something that everybody wants to feel. Falling in love is exciting, but there are a lot of problems, too. When&#160;a new relationship starts, many people wonder how it can influence their&#160;lives.</p><p>In my opinion, falling in love is one of the greatest thrills. First of all, love is intoxicating. Just&#160;the thought of the person you love gives you an intense feeling of joy and excitement. Secondly, when people are in love, they become more optimistic. It&#160;is difficult to make them angry because they no longer pay attention to those things which were a constant source of irritation in the past like traffic jams or a grumpy colleague. In&#160;addition, those who are in love often feel creative, energetic, and exhilarated.</p><p>However, some people think that falling in love might cause them pain. They&#160;may feel confused and scared, especially if they have been hurt before. Others try to avoid falling in love because they are not prepared for meaningful relationships or fear that their love will not be returned. Besides, falling in love may lead to giddiness, loss of sleep and appetite, restlessness, and foolish behaviour.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that those who are afraid of being hurt may never know true happiness. I&#160;do not think that being in love means being stupid or gullible. To&#160;my mind, it</p><p>means being gentle and considerate.</p><p>To sum up, love is a very strong feeling that can change people completely. Those who are in love experience a torrent of positive emotions. I&#160;believe that nothing can make a person happier than mutual&#160;love.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a34">Some people think that jealousy is a very destructive emotion</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Almost everyone experiences jealousy at some point in life. Jealousy is a powerful emotion that can be damaging to relationships. Is&#160;it all right to feel jealous or should people try to overcome&#160;it?</p><p>In my opinion, jealousy can cause huge problems. First of all, it arouses negative emotions like sadness, anger, anxiety, fear, and a feeling of insecurity. Secondly, jealousy may lead to irrational behaviour, a lack of intimacy, a permanent lack of trust, and fights. In&#160;extreme cases, jealousy leads to aggressive behaviour and violence. What&#160;is more, having a jealous partner is exhausting because everything you do will be interpreted wrongly.</p><p>However, some people say that jealousy is a sign of love. They&#160;think that jealousy heightens passion for one&#8217;s partner and keeps a relationship alive. It&#160;can also encourage people to appreciate each other and to make a greater effort to ensure that the person they love feels special.</p><p>Nevertheless, while jealousy in small amounts can heighten emotions, irrational jealousy can be destructive. It&#160;damages relationships and can even cause them to end. I&#160;believe that unselfish and self-confident people are incapable of jealousy. As&#160;somebody once said, &#8216;Jealousy contains more of self-love than of love.&#8217;</p><p>To conclude, when we are jealous, common sense and rationality matter very little, and our emotions get out of control. Jealousy makes people feel frustrated and unhappy. That&#160;is why we should learn to control jealousy; otherwise, it will result in low self-esteem, distrust or even separation.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a36">Some people think that only those who earn a lot of money can be happy</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Most people dream of becoming rich. Some&#160;believe that money can make them powerful, independent and happy, while others think that money may cause them more worries than anything else. The&#160;question arises whether money can solve all problems.</p><p>In my opinion, wealth does not relate to happiness. Firstly, life of the rich is full of dangers. They&#160;have to spend much money on security, but in spite of all the measures that they take, they are often robbed, kidnapped or even killed. Secondly, those who have a lot of money are often lonely and unhappy because other people often try to take advantage of them. Thirdly, money can do more harm than good if it is used irresponsibly or for purchases like alcohol or&#160;drugs.</p><p>However, some people think that the rich live lavish and irresponsible lives. They&#160;can take vacations when they want and buy expensive cars, large mansions, private jets, and other luxury items. Additionally, money can give you increased access to excitement and entertainment. Wealthy people can visit exotic countries, dine at the best restaurants and stay in five-star hotels.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that lying on a beach, sailing a luxury yacht or riding in a limousine may be fun for a short time, but it is not likely to provide long-term satisfaction. Besides, most wealthy people cannot relax and enjoy themselves because they must run their business and make investment decisions all the&#160;time.</p><p>To sum up, there are more important things in life them money. No&#160;matter how rich you are, you cannot buy happiness or good health. I&#160;think that people should be satisfied with what they&#160;have.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a37">Some people think that pocket money teaches teenagers to be responsible</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Teenagers need pocket money for various things like eating out, going to the movies or buying new DVDs. Many&#160;parents are ready to open their wallets, while some of them do not think it is necessary for their kids to have their own money. The&#160;question arises whether it is a good idea to give pocket money to teenagers.</p><p>I think there are a lot of advantages of giving pocket money to young people. Firstly, getting money can teach teenagers money management skills. They&#160;learn to budget and to save. Secondly, some parents give chores to their children so that they can earn some extra pocket money. As&#160;a result, teenagers learn that getting money can be hard&#160;work.</p><p>Additionally, when teenagers have their own money, they realize how much things cost and learn to make smart choices.</p><p>However, some people say that pocket money may cause a number of problems, too. If&#160;teenagers have <span class="s2">too </span>much money, they can become victims of bullying. Besides, it is difficult for parents to control what their children spend their pocket money on. For&#160;example, they may buy junk food or adult magazines.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that parents should learn to trust their children. By&#160;giving pocket money to teenagers, parents show them that they are mature enough to handle the responsibility. This&#160;is a way to build a bond between parents and their children.</p><p>To conclude, getting pocket money can help teenagers to learn skills that will be useful later in life. Money teaches them to be more responsible and independent. I&#160;think that young people should be free to spend their money on what they&#160;want.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a38">Some people say that making money with the Internet is reality</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, many people want to make quick money without doing much work. They&#160;hope that the Internet will help them to become rich. However, is it possible to earn millions with the Internet?</p><p>I think there are numerous ways to make money online. Firstly, you can be employed</p><p>by an internet company.</p><p>Many people make a living building websites, sending spam, writing reviews or articles, or putting advertisements on a web page. Secondly, you can begin your own business on the Internet. For&#160;example, you can create your own website and sell your own product. Additionally, the Internet enables owners of small businesses to reach thousands of consumers with their products and services and helps to increase their sales and profits.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that it is not easy to get rich with the Internet. Firstly, there is usually a lot of competition on the Internet. Companies offer thousands of goods at a cheaper price, which can make it difficult for a new e-business to get off the ground. Besides, it makes much time and effort to build up e-businesses, and the income may be very&#160;small.</p><p>Anyway, one of the advantages of an online business is its low start-up costs. One&#160;will not have to spend much money on web page construction and maintenance.</p><p>To conclude, Internet businesses take time to grow and face stiff competition. Although some people are getting rich and sometimes quickly, it might be naive to think that the Internet can help you make millions in a few days. Of&#160;course, if you work hard, there is a chance that you will succeed.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a39">Some people say that teenagers should work to earn money</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Teenagers need money to buy things that they want. Some&#160;parents encourage their children to work so that they have their own source of money, while others disapprove of teenagers working. The&#160;question arises whether having a job is beneficial to young people.</p><p>I think that teenagers should earn their own money. Firstly, young people with jobs learn to manage money and know its value. Secondly, teenagers who work can contribute to the household income, which takes some of the financial burden off their parents. Moreover, those who work hard to earn money are less likely to buy expensive clothes or electronic gadgets. They&#160;are more careful not to lose their money or lend it to their friends.</p><p>However, some people say that teenagers who earn money and use it at their discretion may spend every penny on clothes, makeup, or socializing. If&#160;their parents do not teach them how to budget and save, they may develop unhealthy spending habits. Besides, some people think that teenagers can learn money management skills if they are given pocket&#160;money.</p><p>Anyway, young people often need more money than their parents can give them. Teenagers with jobs earn larger amounts of money and learn to spend it wisely. I&#160;think young people are more responsible with the money that they have earned.</p><p>To conclude, having a job helps teenagers learn more about personal and financial responsibility. They&#160;learn how to save money for the things they want to buy and how to make smart financial decisions. I&#160;think teenagers are more careful with money when it is not just handed to them whenever they&#160;ask.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a41">Some people say that having a hobby is important for everyone</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, people have many options for spending their free time. Some&#160;people prefer doing something that actually interests, relaxes or excites them such as painting or playing sports, while others admit that they do not have a hobby. However, can we live happily without having a&#160;hobby?</p><p>In my opinion, everybody should have a hobby. Firstly, hobbies help us to relax and reduce stress. For&#160;example, yoga, knitting and gardening help to calm your nerves and to relieve tension after a hard day. Secondly, having a hobby can lead to acquiring skills, knowledge, and experience. Our&#160;interests enrich our lives and help us to gain a better understanding of how the world works. Besides, hobbies give people much room&#160;for</p><p>self-expression.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that having a hobby takes much time and energy, and they cannot fit their interests into their busy schedules. In&#160;addition, sometimes we have to dedicate plenty of money to the activities that we enjoy&#160;doing.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that if you are fond of doing something, you will willingly give much attention and effort to your interests. Some&#160;people even manage to turn hobbies like photography, painting or writing into moneymaking businesses.</p><p>To sum up, hobbies make our lives more interesting and provide many social and health benefits. They&#160;play a very important educational role, improve our physical and mental health and provide us with motivation to increase our knowledge and to improve our skills. In&#160;my opinion, all hobbies are beneficial, though it is not always easy to find the right&#160;one.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a42">Some people say that playing computer games is the best way to spend your free time</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Playing computer games is one of the most popular hobbies today. Computer games are constantly becoming more lifelike and complex, which is the main reason why many people can play for hours. However, is it really a good idea to spend so much time with only a computer for company?</p><p>In my opinion, computer games have a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, their developers have been accused of the depiction of graphic violence, sexual themes, consumption of drugs, alcohol or tobacco, bad language, propaganda, and profanity. Secondly, many games encourage violent behaviour, blur the difference between right and wrong and cause addiction. Moreover, computer games make children and teenagers unsociable and passive.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that computer games give them a chance to forget about their everyday problems and to plunge into exciting adventures. Besides, computer games are meant not only for entertainment. They&#160;can improve gamers&#8217; visual skills and dexterity and help them to develop coordination.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that playing computer games is not the best way to spend your free time. Spending much time in front of the screen leads to decreased physical activity and social interaction with others. We&#160;should not forget that reading, exercising and spending time with our friends are much more worthwhile things.</p><p>To conclude, playing computer games may be fun, but we should be aware of the time we spend. Ardent gamers tend to enjoy virtual reality more than anything else, which can cause them numerous problems. I&#160;think that those who are fond of computer games should make sure that they leave plenty of time in their lives for other interesting and useful activities.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a43">Some people believe that teenagers should not be given too much free time</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Most teenagers complain that lessons, homework and household chores make them feel tired. They&#160;say that they need more leisure time to relax and to do activities that they&#160;enjoy.</p><p>However, is it a good idea to give teenagers more free&#160;time?</p><p>In my opinion, teenagers should have plenty of time for various activities such as sports, hobbies, excursions, drama clubs or music. Firstly, they give young people much room for self-expression and help them acquire skills, knowledge, and experience. Secondly, teenagers who miss out on healthy and educational activities as well as on having fun with their peers may feel isolated and depressed. What&#160;is more, teenagers who are not involved in any leisure activities find it difficult to make new friends and to communicate with other people.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that if teenagers are given much free time, they may waste it on socializing with their friends, having parties or playing computer games. Besides, some teenagers may try drugs or join gangs to battle boredom, which results in health problems, falling grades, violent behaviour and run-ins with the&#160;law.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that if parents know how their children spend their free time, teenagers are less likely to exhibit risky behaviour. Getting teenagers involved in useful activities will help to make them interested in positive things.</p><p>To conclude, there are many interesting things that have educational value and provide entertainment for teenagers. Leisure activities help young people to become healthier and more sociable. I&#160;think teenagers should be involved in various activities and try new things until they find something they&#160;like.</p> </div>

However, the advent of the Internet has changed everything: it provides a totally different and unique method of accessing information, so we can find whatever we need without having to buy a book. The&#160;question arises whether reading books is still necessary.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that reading books is still important. Firstly, it is one of the cheapest and most satisfying forms of entertainment. Secondly, reading is an excellent way to reduce stress and a healthy means of escapism. Books transfer you to other countries and continents, introduce you to amazing people and make you laugh and cry. Thirdly, reading can help you improve your vocabulary and develop your analytical and critical thinking skills.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that reading was one of the few ways to pass the time in the past, but today they know how to use their leisure time. Many&#160;people prefer doing something that interests, relaxes or excites them, ranging from doing extreme sports to playing computer games. Besides, some people think that the fewer books they buy the more trees they&#160;save.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that there is nothing like a good book to help you&#160;relax.</p><p>Additionally, if you are bored with traditional print books and consider yourself a technologically advanced person, e-books are for&#160;you.</p><p>To conclude, the book is an inexhaustible source of information and entertainment.</p><p>Reading fires your imagination and gives you a chance to &#8216;travel&#8217; around the world.

Some&#160;people think that collecting is a useless hobby, while others may become avid collectors. However, is collecting things really worth the time and effort?</p><p>In my opinion, collecting is a very useful pastime. Firstly, it can lead to acquiring knowledge. For&#160;example, if you collect coins, you may learn many interesting facts about foreign currency. By&#160;reading about the things you collect, you add to what you&#160;know.</p><p>Secondly, collecting encourages communication and gives you a chance to meet like-minded people. In&#160;addition, if you are fond of collecting, your friends and family will not have to rack their brains, trying to find you a gift that you would&#160;like.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that there are some disadvantages to collecting.</p><p>Firstly, it usually takes much time to find items for your collection. You&#160;will have to look for sellers and other collectors or browse the Internet in order to find online auction&#160;sites.</p><p>Moreover, some people spend too much money on their collections.</p><p>Anyway, a lot of people collect different things without making special purchases. For&#160;instance, they can collect buttons or seashells. Moreover, even if you collect some rare and expensive things, it can be a good investment. Besides, it is possible to make a decent living by collecting and disposing&#160;items.</p><p>To sum up, people collect things for various reasons. Collecting gives you a chance to increase your knowledge, to meet new people and to get maximum benefit from your free time. It&#160;is as enjoyable and satisfying as many other hobbies.</p> </div>

It&#160;competes with traditional education on every level today. However, is online learning for everyone?</p><p>In my opinion, online education has many advantages. Firstly, it offers convenience and flexibility. Students do not have to attend classes, and they can work at their own pace within a schedule that they set for themselves. Secondly, with the surge in Internet usage, online schools are growing in their offerings and quality. Moreover, online learning can be very interesting. Some&#160;universities offer online student support services, including online advising and tutoring, online textbook offer, and student newspapers.</p><p>On the contrary, some people think that online learning is not as effective as traditional education. One&#160;of the disadvantages is that students cannot enjoy regular in-person interaction with their professors and peers. Online education can be a major challenge for people who find it difficult to manage their time wisely. In&#160;addition, some people think that those who choose online education do not work as much as those who choose traditional education.</p><p>Anyway, having a course online does not mean that there will be less work. Online classes have deadlines and due dates for assignments. Besides, online programs give students quick access to their professors and fellow students through email or Web conferencing.</p><p>To conclude, online learning differs from the traditional classroom. One&#160;of its major advantages is that those who want to receive a good education are no longer limited by geography. I&#160;think that online programs are especially convenient for disabled people and working adults with families.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a48">Some people think that homeschooling is an excellent alternative to traditional education</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, many families are making the decision to teach children at home instead of sending them to school. Some&#160;parents believe that they can provide their children with the education they need to be successful. However, should they choose home schooling or public schooling to achieve this&#160;aim?</p><p>In my opinion, homeschooling has a number of advantages. Firstly, it is very convenient because you do not need to observe school hours, days or terms. Secondly, children who have special educational needs are home educated when school cannot meet the child's needs. Thirdly, homeschooling allows parents to provide a more personalized and adaptable learning environment for the child, and the family can spend more time together.</p><p>On the contrary, some people say that homeschooled children suffer from lack of communication with their peers. They&#160;may also miss out on healthy and educational activities. In&#160;addition to classes, schools organize many extracurricular activities, including sports, drama clubs and&#160;music.</p><p>Anyway, homeschooled children do not face such problems as bullying or peer pressure.</p><p>Besides, they still have opportunities to socialize with other kids and to form friendships. Some&#160;parents organize different activities for their homeschooled children. Kids&#160;are also involved in day-today activities such as shopping or volunteering, which gives them a chance to meet new people and to improve their social skills.</p><p>To conclude, homeschooling requires perseverance and a lot of hard&#160;work.</p><p>Nevertheless, it gives students an opportunity to work on just what they want and when they want. I&#160;think those who receive one-on-one instruction and have no distractions in their learning environment may achieve&#160;more.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a49">Some people think that self-education is not very effective</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Education plays a very important role in our lives. In&#160;today&#8217;s tech-savvy society, people can acquire knowledge not only in the classroom, but also in any informal space. However, is self-education for everyone?</p><p>In my opinion, self-education has a number of advantages. First of all, self-taught people are not dependent on others for knowledge. They&#160;can extend their knowledge and acquire new skills whenever and wherever possible. Secondly, self-education usually costs nothing, and it does not require a fixed lifestyle. What&#160;is more, the process of self-education has become much easier with the vast amounts of information now available on the Internet.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that they depend on teachers and tutors for guidance.</p><p>They need someone who will help them, show them the way to acquire information and knowledge, and encourage their efforts to learn. Others admit that they are too lazy to choose self-education. A&#160;lot of people find it difficult to motivate and discipline themselves.</p><p>Anyway, although self-education may be a challenge for many people, its rewards are numerous. It&#160;helps you to become more intelligent and open-minded. Even&#160;if a person has already obtained a degree, they can continue their self-education.</p><p>To sum up, acquiring knowledge and skills is an ongoing process. Self-education gives you a chance to be anything you want to be or to do anything you want to do. I&#160;believe that the options for self-education are very flexible and the opportunities are unlimited.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a50">Some people think that if you want to get a good education, you should go abroad</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Studying abroad has great appeal for many people. Every year thousands of students go to foreign countries in order to participate in study-abroad programs. However, is studying abroad worth the time and&#160;cost?</p><p>In my opinion, there are numerous advantages of studying in a foreign country. Firstly, those who study abroad have a chance to learn a second language or to enhance a language already learned. Secondly, immersion in a foreign culture helps students broaden their horizons. They&#160;can meet new people and experience new traditions. What&#160;is more, an international education opens employment opportunities in many countries and markets.</p><p>Employers often give preference to students with overseas experience because of their knowledge, flexibility and understanding of other cultures.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that it is better to study in one&#8217;s own country for various reasons. First of all, studying abroad may be very expensive because some countries charge full price for foreign students. Secondly, because of the language barrier and culture shock, students who study in a foreign country often have to deal with added stress to their studies.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that even though you may spend much money to receive a solid education abroad, you will earn it back because people with an international education usually have a lot of job options and high salaries. Besides, some study-abroad programs are sponsored by the student's school.</p><p>To conclude, studying abroad offers a valuable experience and widens cultural horizons. It&#160;is especially beneficial for those who look for employment in foreign countries or in multinational organizations. To&#160;my mind, studying in another country is an exciting experience that almost everyone would like to&#160;have.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a51">Some people think that boys and girls should study separately at different schools</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>There has been an ongoing debate about the pros and cons of coeducation. Some&#160;people are against coeducation, while others believe that it is the only way to receive a well-rounded education for both boys and girls. The&#160;question arises whether students should go&#160;to</p><p>single-sex or mixed schools.</p><p>I think that coeducation is beneficial for both boys and girls. Firstly, co-educational schools enable students to interact with the opposite sex. Co-education makes young people</p><p>more flexible and prepares them for the life in the real world, where men and women live and work alongside each other. Secondly, boys and girls have different opinions, feelings, and patterns of behaviour. Mixed-gender schools teach them to accept the differences in others. Thirdly, boys and girls learn to respect each other when they interact regularly in the same environment.</p><p>However, some people say that interaction with the opposite sex can be a distraction for many students. In&#160;addition, some boys and girls are shy with the other gender. They&#160;may be afraid to raise their hand or to express their opinions during group work, which can hinder their academic performance.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that it is important for young people to feel as confident when they spend time with students of the opposite sex as when they socialize with the same&#160;sex.</p><p>Students who attend single-gender schools may experience difficulty in interacting with the opposite&#160;sex.</p><p>To conclude, co-education gives students a chance to improve their social skills and to become open-minded. Boys&#160;and girls can learn many useful things from each other. I&#160;believe that mixed-gender classes are more effective than single-sex classes.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a52">Some people think that the most important thing for a teacher is to make studying enjoyable for students</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people say that making studying enjoyable is the most important aspect of teaching. Others believe that learning is hard work, and it has nothing to do with fun. So&#160;should teachers try to make the learning process more interesting and satisfying for students?</p><p>I think there is no reason why learning cannot be interesting and pleasurable. Firstly, when the lesson is fun, all students are enthusiastic about learning. Secondly, using games, puzzles, and other interesting tasks encourages all students, even shy ones, to participate actively in the learning process. Besides, students will recognize that a teacher has made an effort to prepare for the lesson, and they will respect him&#160;more.</p><p>However, some people believe that school is a place where students are supposed to acquire knowledge, but not have fun. They&#160;think that students should be able to perform difficult and boring tasks, and that entertaining activities may have a negative impact on their academic performance. Additionally, some people say that teachers should pay more attention to discipline problems or those students who are lagging behind the rest of the class instead of making studying&#160;fun.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that when studying is pleasurable and amusing, students learn better. Moreover, when they find learning enjoyable, they are not likely to cause discipline problems because all their attention is on the lesson.</p><p>To conclude, there are many ways to create an enjoyable working environment for students and to make even difficult tasks more agreeable. Once&#160;students have found that studying can be a pleasure, they will make academic progress. Teachers should make efforts to provide an atmosphere that will encourage students to learn.

								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a53">Some school-leavers think that university is not for them and choose not to go</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Young people who have just left school have to decide whether they should look for a job or go to university. The&#160;vast majority of people say that universities offer excellent academic and social opportunities. However, is higher education really worth the time and&#160;cost?</p><p>In my opinion, a university degree gives students numerous advantages. Firstly, a university education gives students access to a lot of courses and subjects and allows them to specialize. Secondly, a person with higher education has more job options than&#160;a</p><p>school-leaver. Today, employers are looking for those who are fully trained in the profession. A&#160;degree will certainly help young people meet tough job requirements. In&#160;addition, those who go to university usually have better communication and social skills than those who begin to work right out of secondary school.</p><p>Nevertheless, some young people think that secondary education is sufficient to obtain</p><p>a job. Many&#160;companies have their own training programs for their employees. Moreover, a university education is time-consuming and expensive, so it may be better to invest the money you would have spent on your degree into a business.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that even though you may spend much money to receive a higher education, you will earn it back because a person with a university degree usually earns more than someone with only secondary education.</p><p>To sum up, a university education prepares young people for life and increases their career prospects. Graduates are considered to be intelligent, broad-minded, flexible,</p><p>self-reliant, and independent. I&#160;believe that they are more likely to get a good job and to succeed.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a54">Some people think that computers may replace teachers in the future</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, virtual schools and online programs are available to almost everyone. Computers are becoming more and more sophisticated, and they offer students the opportunity to learn. Does&#160;that mean the traditional classroom teacher will be replaced by the electronic machine in the future?</p><p>In my opinion, the learning process is impossible without teachers. Firstly, they serve as a positive role model for young people. Secondly, teachers help students become critical thinkers and researchers. They&#160;teach young people to set goals, to analyse information, to gather data, and to draw conclusions. Moreover, teachers are responsible for their students&#8217; social development.</p><p>However, some people believe that we do not need teachers any more. With&#160;computers, learning can be round-the-clock, and it can happen anywhere in the world. Besides, computers can provide students with detailed information about a wide variety of subjects, and they can present it in the form and pace that is suitable for each student.</p><p>Anyway, the role of teachers is not just to transmit knowledge to students and to correct their mistakes. They&#160;also teach young people to communicate with each other, to respect their classmates, and to be part of a team. If&#160;we use computers instead of teachers, children may become as unemotional as electronic machines.</p><p>To conclude, the teacher serves as an educator, a mentor, and a guide. The&#160;teacher motivates students, inspires them to acquire knowledge and skills, and helps them become self-disciplined and responsible for their actions. I&#160;think technology can hardly ever replace the teacher in the classroom because no computer will encourage you to learn or try to find an individual approach to your&#160;needs.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a55">Some people believe that exams are the best way to check the student&#8217;s knowledge</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Most people have to take exams at certain points of their lives. Exams serve to evaluate students&#8217; knowledge and to show them how far is still left to go. However, are exams really a good way of testing students?</p><p>In my opinion, exams are very useful. Firstly, they make students face an intellectual challenge and test their knowledge, skills, and abilities. Secondly, exams encourage young people to improve their knowledge of the subject and to revise information that has been learnt over a period of time. In&#160;addition, students always know that they are to take exams at the end of the term and learn the new material so that they will not have to cram&#160;later.</p><p>On the contrary, some people think that the results of exams are not always quite objective. Sometimes students who often miss classes receive passing grades as easily as those who have attended classes regularly. It&#160;is obvious that they have crammed or figured out a way to cheat. Besides, exams can cause considerable stress. Some&#160;students fail exams because of fear or anxiety about not passing.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that exams are important because they help teachers understand whether students are ready to be promoted to the next level. Besides, students will have no opportunity to cheat if the examination procedure is strict.</p><p>To conclude, it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare for an exam. Exams&#160;make</p><p>students work hard, try to understand complicated material and retain information for their future tests and exams. I&#160;think preparing for exams teaches students self-discipline and time management skills that will be useful in the future.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a56">Many people think that homework is essential for every student</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people think that homework is rote work that takes much time, without offering students any benefit. However, others say that though boring, homework is going to benefit students later in life. The&#160;question arises whether schoolchildren should be assigned homework.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that homework has a number of advantages. Firstly, it helps students understand and retain the information they are learning and prepares them for upcoming lessons. Secondly, homework extends the learning process and teaches students to gain skills and knowledge independently. In&#160;addition, homework teaches young people responsibility, discipline and time management skills.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that too much homework may cause more harm than good. Firstly, schoolchildren who spend a lot of time doing homework may feel stressed and lose interest in school. Secondly, children need time for other activities. Many&#160;students spend their time completing homework assignments rather than exercising, playing sports, or socializing with their friends and family.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that homework gives parents and children an opportunity to interact and spend more time together. Besides, students can develop a routine that will enable them to finish their homework efficiently.</p><p>To sum up, homework is a marker of students&#8217; progress, and it helps teachers understand if schoolchildren have grasped the material. Though homework is sometimes boring, tiring and time consuming, it helps increase students&#8217; knowledge by forcing them to practice their lessons over and over again. To&#160;my mind, homework improves young people&#8217;s skills and helps them become self-reliant and independent.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a57">Some people believe that students should be allowed to choose the subjects they want to study</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, students have to study many subjects. The&#160;government and educators are convinced that they &#8216;know better&#8217; what schoolchildren should be interested in. However, can students be allowed to decide what they want to&#160;study?</p><p>In my opinion, students should be able to choose the subjects they want to&#160;study.</p><p>Firstly, it gives them freedom and independence. Secondly, if students are encouraged to study the subjects they love, they will get better grades. What&#160;is more, if students are forced to learn all subjects, they might do poorly in school or drop out of school.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that students should learn all subjects because it broadens their horizons and makes them well rounded. Besides, if students are allowed to choose what they want to study, they may go for the easiest and most enjoyable subjects or the subjects that their friends are taking or that their parents find useful.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that although some students need guidance, they should have some say in what they are taught at school. Most&#160;schoolchildren know what sparks their interest and what they are talented at. If&#160;their courses are more flexible and selective, students are more likely to excel academically.</p><p>To conclude, ideally, schools should establish required classes that every student must take like maths, science, literature and history as well as elective classes that can broaden students&#8217; knowledge and skills like home economics and music. Nobody should decide which elective classes a student will study except students themselves. I&#160;believe that young people will have a more positive attitude towards school if they are allowed to choose the subjects that they&#160;like.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a58">Some people think that grades encourage students to learn</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people are convinced that grades are important for the student&#8217;s success. Others think that schools should stop using the grading system as the child&#8217;s spirits sink when he&#160;or</p><p>she gets low grades. However, is it a good idea to eliminate grading?</p><p>In my opinion, schools cannot do without grades. Firstly, they serve to monitor the student's progress. Without grades, students would have little idea about their progress and failures and would not be able to compare their results with those of their classmates.</p><p>Secondly, grades increase students&#8217; motivation, competitiveness and a desire to excel. Thirdly, grades help both students and teachers to stay organized and to set&#160;goals.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that learning without grades has some advantages. Firstly, it can teach students to value learning instead of rewards and not to be afraid of failures and punishments. Low&#160;grades can make students less confident and less willing to learn. Besides, teachers may favour one student over another. Therefore, one more disadvantage of the grading system is its subjectivity.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that low grades can also encourage students to work harder in order to improve their academic performance. At&#160;the same time, higher grades give students satisfaction and show them that they are making good progress.</p><p>To conclude, grades provide an incentive for students to study and to improve their skills. They&#160;teach young people to evaluate their own work and to put more effort into their schoolwork in order to achieve success. That&#160;is why I&#160;think that grades should be an integral part of any educational system.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a59">Some people think that students will use computers instead of textbooks in the future</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, computers are being used in schools, and new technologies are being integrated into lesson plans. However, the use of computers in the classroom raises questions about whether they are beneficial to learning and whether they are going to make textbooks obsolete in the future. Will&#160;computers change the way students are taught at school?</p><p>I think there is a possibility that computers and laptops may replace traditional textbooks in the future. Firstly, computers can store a lot of books and give both students and teachers immediate access to current information. Secondly, computers can motivate students and make learning more enjoyable. In&#160;addition, laptops are easier to carry because they weigh less than a backpack full of hardcover textbooks.</p><p>On the contrary, some people believe that textbooks will not disappear. Firstly, they are cheaper, easier to use, and they are less likely to cause eye strain when used over long periods of time. Secondly, computers can isolate students as they work on individual projects at their own speed. When&#160;students work together, they learn to respect their classmates, to resolve conflicts and to be part of a&#160;team.</p><p>Nevertheless, textbooks and encyclopaedias may contain outdated information.</p><p>Besides, as students learn at different rates, computers can help those who need assistance and provide more advanced students with additional information and further learning activities.</p><p>To conclude, technology is becoming an important part of education. Educational software is an excellent supplement to traditional textbooks. I&#160;think that teachers should move with the times and use up-to-date technology in the classroom to make their lessons more interesting.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a60">Some people think that creativity is an essential ability which must be taught at school</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, schools use standardized tests and drills that stifle creativity. Some&#160;people think that it is important to bring creativity into the classroom rather than merely teach students basic skills. However, should creativity be promoted in schools?</p><p>In my opinion, teachers should encourage creativity. Firstly, the ability to solve problems creatively plays a significant role in building a successful career. Secondly, developing a child&#8217;s creativity is important for building self-confidence. Besides, students love to be creative and to use imagination in order to produce new ideas and things.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that not all subjects are equally conducive to creativity. Students can be creative when they are assigned to write an essay or to do a project, but it&#160;is</p><p>difficult for schoolchildren to use their imagination when they are given mathematical problems to solve. Additionally, those who think outside the box are sometimes discouraged from being creative because not all students are equally inventive, and some of them may feel inferior to others.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that although some students are more creative than others, it does not mean that the teacher should not encourage creativity in the classroom. On&#160;the contrary, the teacher should provide more assistance to those who find it difficult to use their creativity and imagination. I&#160;think that even a teacher of mathematics can encourage creativity by teaching students to explore, investigate, and discover.</p><p>To conclude, creativity is essential to the future success of the student. Creative people can come up with innovative ideas, and they are often able to see options and solutions where others cannot. I&#160;think students need to express themselves creatively at school.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a61">Some people think that punishment should be used in class to achieve discipline and to make students study hard</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The use of punishments in the classroom is so controversial that it provokes an ongoing debate. Some&#160;people believe that punishment helps teachers to create an effective learning environment for students, while others are against using punishment at school. Is&#160;it really a good idea to punish students for bad behaviour and low grades?</p><p>In my opinion, punishment in the classroom has more positives than negatives. Firstly, it makes students realize what kind of behaviour is inappropriate in the classroom setting. Punishment can eliminate or prevent bad behaviour because students know that they will have to face the consequences of their actions. Secondly, it is well known that students find any punishment unpleasant, so they try to be well-behaved and to get good grades in order to avoid receiving it. Thirdly, punishment teaches students to respect authority and their classmates.</p><p>However, some people believe that punishment humiliates students. It&#160;fills children with fear and guilt, and they may lose interest in learning. Besides, students who are put in detention or sent to the principal's office as a punishment are taken away from their lessons.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that some punishments do not make students feel ashamed or embarrassed. For&#160;example, giving schoolchildren some extra work as a punishment encourages them to improve their knowledge of the subject and to become more disciplined.</p><p>To sum up, schoolchildren need to learn that those who misbehave deserve punishment, while good behaviour is rewarded. There are different punishments that help teachers to improve school results and to discourage students from breaking school rules. I&#160;believe that schools should be strict about discipline and students&#8217; academic performance.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a63">Some people say that having jobs can be of great benefit to teenagers</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, many teenagers choose to get part-time jobs. Most&#160;parents encourage their children to work; others think that their kids need to focus on their studies. Is&#160;it really a good idea to get a job while still in school?</p><p>In my opinion, jobs offer a lot of benefits to young people. Firstly, teenagers who work learn to manage money. Secondly, they learn valuable employment skills, such as dealing with other people&#8217;s problems or showing up to work on time. Thirdly, teenagers learn to work as a team and to interact with all types of people.</p><p>However, some people say that balancing work and school can be difficult. Having a job may hinder young people&#8217;s academic performance because many teenagers get tired after work and do not have enough time to complete their assignments. In&#160;addition, teenagers with jobs do not have an opportunity to relax and to exercise and spend less time with their families and friends.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think there is no reason why teenagers should not have jobs, as long as they work hours that allow them to finish their homework, to participate in extracurricular activities and to socialize with their peers. Besides, as young people with jobs have less free time, they are less likely to get into trouble.</p><p>To conclude, having a job teaches young people about responsibility and helps them acquire skills that will be useful in the future. Teenagers with jobs often develop a sense of maturity and self-confidence and gain work experience. I&#160;think that the jobs young people choose give them a chance to try different things and help them define their place in the&#160;world.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a64">Some people say that they would prefer to work at home</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>With recent advances in technology, including the growth in telecommuting, many people have a chance to work at home. Some&#160;of them think that to work from home means to get up late and to work in their pyjamas. However, is it really as perfect as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>In my opinion, working at home has a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, there may be too many distractions from family members and friends. Secondly, those who work at home may suffer from social isolation. They&#160;often miss office socializing and the chance to chat with their colleagues. Thirdly, working from home is only for those who are self-motivated and self-reliant. People who depend on guidance and lack self-discipline will find working from home challenging.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that the advantage of working from home is that you can create a flexible work schedule that suits your lifestyle. Working from home allows you to spend more time with your family, which is especially convenient for those who have kids or handicapped family members living with them. In&#160;addition, you can save a lot of time and money because you do not have to travel to and from&#160;work.</p><p>Anyway, some work-from-home jobs require travel. Besides, you may have to commute for certain meetings. Moreover, sometimes those who work from home do not take breaks and overwork.</p><p>To sum up, one should never forget that working at home is still working. It&#160;requires commitment, discipline, and good time management skills. Personally, I&#160;would prefer to work at an office because I&#160;think it is difficult to create a good working environment at&#160;home.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a65">Some people think that it is more important to get satisfaction from your work than to earn much money</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people would prefer to work at an enjoyable job for less money; others would choose the job that offers more money even if they do not like it. A&#160;high salary often plays a key role in career decisions. However, should your career choice be based solely on future earnings?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that money is not the most important thing. Firstly, those who work only for the money may never find true fulfilment in the jobs that they do. Secondly, people who work in uncomfortable or dangerous conditions, lack benefits or have no opportunities for promotion will hardly be satisfied with their jobs no matter how much they are&#160;paid.</p><p>Thirdly, if your work is well-paid but repetitive and tedious, you are likely to resign sooner or&#160;later.</p><p>Nevertheless, a lot of people say that the main factor in their jobs is the money that they are paid to do them. Many&#160;employees have families to support and need enough money to maintain a lifestyle they want. Besides, if they receive a high salary, they feel that other people value their competence and professionalism.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that a low salary does not mean that a person who receives it is unqualified. Besides, sometimes even a high salary cannot satisfy a person&#8217;s individual&#160;needs.</p><p>To conclude, the job that you will choose is going to affect your physical, mental and emotional well-being. When&#160;you look for a job, you should think of a career that will be intellectually rewarding and personally fulfilling. I&#160;think that people who are satisfied with their jobs are happier and have better health.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a66">Some people think that in any occupation discipline is more important than talent</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people believe that only talented employees can build a successful career. Others think that it is more important to be hard-working and self-disciplined. So&#160;what is the key to success?</p><p>I think it is more important to be disciplined than talented. Firstly, any work requires the ability to control your own behaviour. If&#160;employees lack discipline and do not do what they are expected to do, they will not be able to achieve professional success. Those who are often late for work or miss deadlines may be fired. Secondly, disciplined employees know how to put their time to best use, which leads to increased profit for an organization. Thirdly, disciplined employees can create a pleasant environment in which they can work efficiently.</p><p>However, some people say that those who do not have talent become ordinary hard workers, but they will hardly become outstanding or produce any new ideas or things.</p><p>Besides, one needs talent for many professions. For&#160;example, it is impossible to be a great artist or songwriter if you do not have a natural ability to paint or to write poetry and&#160;music.</p><p>Besides talent, one needs diligence and perseverance to be successful even in these professions. It&#160;is well known that if you do not work hard to develop your talent, you are likely to waste&#160;it.</p><p>To conclude, discipline is important in all aspects of life, including work. Everybody needs a good deal of discipline to be more productive and successful. If&#160;you want to achieve whatever goals you set for your life, you should work hard, but first you need to learn to discipline yourself.</p> </div>

Some&#160;young people choose careers that mirror their family members' professions; others try to succeed in a different field. Is&#160;it really a good idea to do the same job as someone in your family?</p><p>In my opinion, there are many disadvantages to following in one&#8217;s parents&#8217; footsteps when making career choices. Firstly, those who sacrifice their personal interests and talents for their families and choose a career that they do not find fulfilling may feel dissatisfied with their jobs. Secondly, when parents encourage their kids to enter their field, they sometimes push them too hard, which can have a negative impact on family relationships. Thirdly, when young people work in the family business, it is difficult for them to separate family matters and work matters.</p><p>However, some people say that family contacts can help young people to obtain&#160;an</p><p>occupation. Besides, adolescents can see the benefits and disadvantages of their parents' careers. They&#160;usually feel more secure about the future when they work with people that they&#160;trust.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that young people should choose careers that align with their personal interests and skills. To&#160;my mind, a boy who is interested in music will be unhappy if he becomes an engineer like his father.</p><p>To conclude, a person&#8217;s family can have a significant impact on their career choice.</p><p>Young people need to decide whether a career in the same field is for them, or whether they want to take the opposite route. I&#160;think they need to explore any career opportunities.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a68">Some people change their jobs every few years</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some years ago, a lot of employees preferred to work at a company for most of their professional lives. However, nowadays it is much more difficult to stay with the same business for a long time. Does&#160;that mean that people should now change their jobs more often than they did in the&#160;past?</p><p>In my opinion, changing jobs may have plenty of benefits. The&#160;main advantage of moving from job to job is finding the one that you will enjoy or that will allow you to earn more money. Secondly, changing jobs will give you great experience because you will have a chance to work with different people and to perform various tasks. Thirdly, those who have worked at the same company for many years may be afraid of any changes. Such&#160;employees do not resign even if they are dissatisfied with their&#160;jobs.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that it is better to work at the same company for a long period of time. Firstly, those who constantly change their jobs may be viewed as people who cannot be committed to the organization. In&#160;addition, job-hoppers never build long-term relationships with their co-workers.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that a skilled employee will have no difficulty in finding a new&#160;job.</p><p>Besides, sociable people can easily make friends with their colleagues.</p><p>To conclude, a career change can be very beneficial. If&#160;you do not enjoy your work or your employer does not offer any opportunities for career advancement, you should probably think about looking for another job. I&#160;am sure you will be happier if you love the work that you&#160;do.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a69">Some people think that it is better to work abroad</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Due to the transition to global business, a lot of people now have a chance to work in a foreign country. Some&#160;employees prefer to work in their own country, while others find working overseas very appealing. However, does working abroad offer many advantages?</p><p>In my opinion, working in a foreign country can be very rewarding. First and foremost, those who work abroad have an opportunity to experience a new country and culture while getting paid in the process. Secondly, they gain valuable work experience that can help them to build a successful career. What&#160;is more, those who work in a foreign country have a chance to learn a second language or to enhance a language already learned.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that working abroad has some disadvantages. Firstly, one may have problems with getting a work permit and settling in. Secondly, those who work abroad often miss their families and friends. Besides, they find having to speak a foreign language all the time rather exhausting.</p><p>Anyway, despite all these challenges, many people claim that if they were offered a job in a foreign country, they would jump at the chance because they think that working abroad is a satisfying experience. Those who work overseas gain an understanding of other cultures and become more flexible.</p><p>To conclude, working in a foreign country is for those who like adventure and enjoy a challenge. It&#160;helps people to gain competence and to realize their full potential. I&#160;think that working abroad offers a valuable experience and widens cultural horizons.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a70">Some people believe that they will be successful and happy only if they work much</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, many people admit that they work too much. They&#160;arrive at work as soon as the building opens, take work home with them and even spend weekend time at the office.</p><p>However, should people put work before anything&#160;else?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that those who choose to work a lot may face plenty of problems. Firstly, people who are truly addicted to their work do not have time for exercising, eating healthy food or sleeping enough. As&#160;a result, they often have poor health and feel stressed. Secondly, those who are in the office for twelve hours a day cannot have a proper work-life balance. They&#160;cannot relax and do not spend much time with family and friends. Thirdly, it is boring to socialize with people who can talk only about their&#160;work.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that working too much can have some benefits.</p><p>Firstly, those who work a lot make a significant contribution to the organization and can win promotion. In&#160;addition, they can get additional vacation&#160;time.</p><p>A as a rule, workaholics seldom take vacations. Even&#160;if they do, they often take a laptop and a mobile phone so that they can continue working. Moreover, when such people are promoted, they push themselves too hard and may have a breakdown.</p><p>To conclude, balancing work with social activities and joys is essential for everyone. Overworking can be detrimental to one&#8217;s health, social life and personal relationships. I&#160;think that people should schedule time for family, friends and interests.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a71">At present, there is no difficulty in finding a good job</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>It is a well-known fact that the process of seeking employment may be rather difficult and time-consuming. Some&#160;people believe that one can get a good job, but it is very tricky. However, is it really&#160;so?</p><p>In my opinion, one can easily get a job these days. Firstly, recent technological advances, including the mobile telephone and the Internet, allow job seekers to contact their past employers, co-workers and friends in order to find out about openings and ask for job tips. Secondly, one can visit different job search sites and complete an application or upload a resume. Thirdly, job seekers can attend career fairs where they can get information about different kinds of&#160;jobs.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that entering the job market is tough today. Difficult economic times often lead to downsizing and numerous job losses. Technological development also contributes to unemployment. For&#160;example, the use of robotic mechanisms in industry reduces the number of workers needed to perform certain&#160;tasks.</p><p>Anyway, in spite of all these problems, many people manage to find a good job. If&#160;job seekers prove that they are capable of doing the job and will be an asset to the company, they are likely to be hired. Even&#160;those who do not have job experience can find temporary&#160;or</p><p>part-time jobs that will help them acquire new skills and explore their interests.</p><p>To sum up, if you want to find a good job, you should know what to look for. Good&#160;education opens the door to a wide range of career options. If&#160;you are patient and persistent, you can easily get a&#160;job.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a72">Some people think that there is nothing worse than being unemployed</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>A lot of different factors, including an economic downturn and technological development, can result in an increase in the unemployment rate. Losing a job is a very sad event for many people. However, is it really as bad to be unemployed as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>In my opinion, job loss may have detrimental emotional, mental and physical effects. Firstly, those who are out of work experience anxiety and feel depressed because they lose the ability to purchase goods and services and to pay bills. Secondly, unemployed people often lose social contacts and feel isolated. What&#160;is more, loss of income and the financial stress of being unable to provide the basics of food, shelter and clothing may lead to quarrels between spouses and then to divorce.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that unemployment has some advantages. Firstly, it gives people a chance to look at their lives from a new perspective and to set future goals. Secondly, people without jobs receive unemployment benefits. Some&#160;of them do not want to look for new employment, since they are receiving government assistance without having to&#160;work.</p><p>Anyway, unemployment benefits are only a portion of a person&#8217;s full former salary. Besides, one can be on unemployment benefit only temporarily. Therefore, unemployment often leads to poverty, which, in turn, may cause&#160;crime.</p><p>To conclude, job loss can be a very unpleasant experience, but it is not a life tragedy. Unemployment can lead to depression, social isolation or the breakup of a family only if a person gives up easily. I&#160;think that unemployed people should try to stay positive and keep searching.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a73">Many people believe that it is important to develop teamwork in the workplace</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, employees often have to work cooperatively with others in order to achieve business goals. While there are some definite advantages of teamwork, there are also some drawbacks. The&#160;question therefore arises whether teamwork results in higher or decreased productivity.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that there are numerous benefits of teamwork. Firstly, working together increases efficiency and productivity. Team&#160;members combine their talent and contribute their knowledge and skills to accomplishing the task. Secondly, team members share duties and accomplish complex tasks more quickly. Thirdly, when people with different backgrounds and points of view work together and share their experiences and ideas, they learn to understand and respect each&#160;other.</p><p>However, some people think that there are some disadvantages to employees working together. Firstly, when people work in a team, not everyone contributes equally. Some&#160;individuals work hard, while others make a minimal effort and prefer to wait for someone else to accomplish the set goals. In&#160;addition, those who are used to working alone may find it difficult to work in a team, which may lead to conflict with other team members.</p><p>Anyway, sometimes working alone is rather difficult. In&#160;my opinion, people working as a team can accomplish more tasks than the same people working individually. In&#160;a team one person&#8217;s weaknesses are compensated for by another person's strengths. Besides, effective teams can resolve conflicts quickly.</p><p>To conclude, more minds work better them a single one. Working in a team helps to reach goals and to increase productivity in the workplace. I&#160;think that all job seekers and employees should develop teamwork skills.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a74">Some people prefer to work for themselves or to own a business</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, many people decide to leave their jobs and to start their own businesses. They&#160;dream of making loads of money and getting personal satisfaction from doing something that they enjoy. However, is business ownership as rewarding as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>In my opinion, there are a lot of advantages of owning a business. Firstly, those who work for themselves can make more money than those who work for an employer. Secondly, business owners can make their own decisions and determine how much they would like to work. In&#160;addition, people who own a business have an opportunity to turn their interests into a full-time job and to do something that they&#160;love.</p><p>On the contrary, some people believe that those who are going to start a business should be ready to work long hours with little or no pay at first. Business owners often need to do menial tasks and to work hard to get their businesses off the ground. What&#160;is more, many new businesses fail within the first several&#160;years.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that &#8216;when nothing is ventured, nothing is gained&#8217;. To&#160;my mind, people should take a risk and start a business. I&#160;think that business owners have more freedom and can control their future.</p><p>To sum up, it is difficult to start and run your own business these days. Nevertheless,</p><p>although you will have to put a lot of time, effort and money into it, having your own business is rewarding. If&#160;you are prepared to work hard and to accept challenges, you are likely to succeed.</p> </div>

Some&#160;people say that advances in technology make our lives easier and save our time and money, while others believe that they have a lot of drawbacks. The&#160;question arises whether technology is a blessing or a&#160;curse.</p><p>To my mind, new technologies have numerous benefits to mankind. Firstly, they allow people to access and download a vast and diverse amount of up-to-date information.</p><p>Secondly, communication technologies enable us to stay in constant touch with our colleagues, friends, and family members. In&#160;addition, the use of new technologies in industry has led to cheaper production of various&#160;goods.</p><p>However, some people are convinced that modern technologies have negative health, environmental and economic effects. First of all, technology may cause health problems, including eye strain, obesity, and heart problems. Secondly, waste from technology pollutes the environment. What&#160;is more, the use of new technologies leads to unemployment and job losses.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that technology increases efficiency and productivity. For&#160;instance, new equipment allows people to produce more food and goods with less work. Besides, as technology improves, people can receive better medical treatment and survive many diseases. Additionally, environmentally friendly technology uses a lot of methods for reducing the human impact on the&#160;Earth.</p><p>To sum up, technology has a significant impact on society. Modern technology has improved human longevity and health and allowed people to achieve different commercial and industrial goals. I&#160;think that new technologies have improved many areas of life and allowed us to live more comfortably.</p> </div>

However, along with all of the conveniences of the mobile phone, the device has some drawbacks. The&#160;question therefore arises whether people should continue using cell phones.</p><p>In my opinion, the benefits of mobile phones outweigh the disadvantages. Firstly, cell phones help friends and family members to stay in touch and allow people to be contactable wherever they are. Secondly, many people carry mobile phones in case an emergency arises. Thirdly, cell phones enable businessmen to conduct business wherever they are and at any time of day or&#160;night.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that mobile phones can have negative health effects.</p><p>For example, some people think that the microwave radiation that cell phones emit can cause such illnesses as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In&#160;addition, mobile phones harm the environment because they contain heavy metals and toxic substances. Cell&#160;phones that are discarded end up in landfills and contaminate soil and drinking&#160;water.</p><p>I believe that excessive use of cell phones can be a health hazard. Anyway, you will hardly have any health problems if you do not chat on the phone for hours. Besides, people should not forget that mobile phones need to be recycled or disposed of properly. Electronic manufacturers have already created more durable and eco-friendly cell phones.</p><p>To conclude, as cell phones are becoming more sophisticated, their use is increasing. Mobile phones provide convenience, safety, and entertainment. Advanced technology and reasonable price of cell phones make them even more popular and affordable.</p> </div>

There&#160;is</p><p>an ongoing debate about whether schoolchildren should be allowed to use cell phones in school. The&#160;question has arisen whether mobile phones must be banned in the classroom.</p><p>In my opinion, there are several reasons why having mobile phones in schools can be a good thing. Firstly, students with cell phones can easily contact family members in an emergency or when they just need something. Secondly, children with medical issues can use their phone to call an ambulance or a doctor. In&#160;addition, most cell phones have a range of tools that can be useful during school hours. Students can use their phones to access educational websites, to videotape a teacher's lecture and then to email it to absent classmates.</p><p>However, some people oppose cell phones in school. Firstly, some students use mobile phones to cheat. For&#160;example, they may share answers to tests and quizzes. Secondly, mobile phones can be disruptive during lessons if they are turned on. In&#160;addition, students often use their cell phones to listen to music, to play games or to send text messages to each&#160;other.</p><p>Anyway, most cell phones have a silent feature, so they can be left on without the audio disturbing anyone. Besides, strict teachers do not give their students a chance to cheat or to misuse their mobile phones.</p><p>To conclude, there are many reasons why students should carry cell phones. They&#160;facilitate learning and communication and are useful in case of emergency. I&#160;think educators should teach students how to use cell phones at school properly.</p> </div>

However, some adults worry about the impact of cell phones on young people. They&#160;wonder if it is a good idea to allow teenagers to use mobile phones.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that there are a lot of reasons to give teenagers cell phones. First and foremost, young people with mobile phones can call their parents or an emergency service in case of an accident. Mobile monitoring applications allow parents to monitor their children&#8217;s location and ensure that they are safe. Secondly, thanks to mobile phones, teenagers can stay in constant touch with their friends. Thirdly, cell phones can be used for educational purposes. They&#160;enable teenagers to access educational websites, to use electronic dictionaries and to download books, educational games, and TV programs.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people disapprove of the increase in cell phone usage. They&#160;think that teenagers often chat on the phone when they should be doing homework or household chores. What&#160;is more, many parents complain that their children spend too much money on their mobile phone. Most&#160;teenagers do not pay for the phone, and therefore they do not know how much it&#160;costs.</p><p>Anyway, parents can teach their children how to use cell phones properly. I&#160;believe that giving a teenager a mobile phone can teach them responsibility and money management.</p><p>To sum up, more teenagers have cell phones than ever before. Mobile phones enable young people to communicate with their family and friends from any location, provide safety and help teenagers to learn.

Along with the benefits that the Internet brings, it has plenty of disadvantages. Therefore, the question arises whether the Internet is a blessing or a&#160;curse.</p><p>In my opinion, the Internet can improve our lives in different ways. Firstly, Internet users have easy, instant access to a vast amount of up-to-date information. They&#160;can access news, documents, images and sounds and publish their ideas to a large audience. Secondly, the Internet has made it possible for us to communicate with people all over the world. What&#160;is more, the Internet has become a major source of leisure.</p><p>However, some people say that one should take the disadvantages of the Internet into consideration when using it. As&#160;the number of websites increases, the amount of time spent navigating sites and looking for a particular piece of information will increase, too. Another</p><p>drawback is receiving information that is unreliable, falsified or exaggerated. People cannot always trust what they read on the&#160;web.</p><p>Anyway, one cannot deny that there are thousands of useful websites on the Internet.</p><p>The Internet provides immediate and easy access to current information, while news programs and newspapers may contain day-old or even week-old news.,</p><p>To sum up, the Internet makes our lives easier and opens up loads of opportunities for millions of people worldwide.

However, a lot of people worry about the impact of the Internet on children. They&#160;wonder if it is a good idea to allow kids to use the Internet.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that there are many reasons why children should use the Internet. Firstly, thanks to the Internet, they can access news, documents, images, sounds, and video. Secondly, the Internet helps children to connect with their classmates and widens their circle of friends. They&#160;get to know other people from around the world, which opens them up to other cultures and languages. What&#160;is more, the Internet is a wonderful tool to use for homework assignments.</p><p>On the contrary, the Internet can have negative impacts on children. The&#160;excessive use of the Internet can isolate kids from family and friends and affect their social development. A&#160;child spending a lot of time in front of a screen does not exercise much and faces a higher risk of poor health. In&#160;addition, kids can stumble upon inappropriate websites when using the Internet.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that modern children cannot live without the Internet because it is a great source of information and entertainment for them. I&#160;think that parents should not forbid their children to use the Internet. Nevertheless, they must limit the amount of time their kids spend accessing the Internet and evaluate the sites and social networks their children&#160;use.</p><p>To conclude, the Internet opens up loads of opportunities for children today.

Firstly, the Internet provides teachers and students with instant access to information on thousands of different topics. Secondly, students use the World Wide Web for doing homework assignments. If&#160;schoolchildren need to find information for an essay or project, there are a lot of excellent websites and online encyclopaedias. Thirdly, the Internet enables teachers and students to contact people from all over the world at the click of a&#160;mouse.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say there are a number of disadvantages to using the Internet for educational purposes. First of all, students may find it difficult to understand whether the information they find on the Internet is reliable or not. They&#160;may acquire inaccurate or outdated information online. In&#160;addition, some students use the Internet to download music or to chat online and forget about their homework.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that teachers can instruct students how to use the Internet properly.

The&#160;question is whether the advantages of social networks outweigh the drawbacks.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that social networks have a lot of benefits. Firstly, they link together people who have common interests and give them an opportunity to look for friends, build communities, send messages and share news and pictures. Secondly, many people use social networks to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes.</p><p>Additionally, some use social networking as a job search&#160;tool.</p><p>However, some people say that those who use social networks often receive unreliable information and may take opinion as fact. In&#160;addition, some users are worried about data theft and viruses. Many&#160;people give out too much personal information that may be passed to third parties for different purposes.</p><p>Anyway, social networks allow users to choose who can view their profile in order to protect their privacy. This&#160;prevents unauthorized users from accessing, adding, changing, or removing personal information and pictures.</p><p>To sum up, millions of people use social networks for fun as well as for business and educational purposes. The&#160;main advantage of social networking sites is that they help people establish better relationships with friends, business partners and clients even if they live thousands of miles apart. I&#160;think that social networks will continue to grow in popularity because more and more computer users find it easier to interact with others through electronic communication.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a84">Some people believe that there are real risks to dating via the Internet</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Internet dating is increasing in popularity. Today, many people are looking for love via the web, while others say that meeting people online may be dangerous. Can&#160;online dating be a viable alternative to real world dating?</p><p>In my opinion, Internet dating has a lot of advantages. Firstly, it can be helpful for busy people who do not have time to go out and attend social events. Secondly, online dating gives you a chance to get to know people before meeting them in person. What&#160;is more, with Internet dating, you can date people who live in other cities and even countries.</p><p>However, some people say that online dating is too risky. You&#160;can never be sure that you are communicating with the individual whose personal information and photos you can see. For&#160;example, you may discover that a 25-year-old man you have met online is 50.</p><p>Besides, it is very dangerous to give detailed personal information to complete strangers because your online friend might be a fraud or a criminal.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that online dating can be safe if done properly. You&#160;should never give your full name, address or phone number to people that you meet online. One&#160;of the advantages of Internet dating is that it gives you some time to decide whether you trust someone or&#160;not.</p><p>To sum up, in today's hectic world, it has become more challenging to meet people. The&#160;Internet gives everybody an opportunity to explore dating options. I&#160;think that online dating sites allow computer users to expand their social circle and to find a perfect&#160;match.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a85">Some people think that online chatting cannot substitute for face-to-face communication</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The number of people that chat online has increased. Today, users do not have to visit or call someone to communicate. So&#160;the question arises whether Internet chatting is taking</p><p>over too much of our&#160;lives.</p><p>I think that online chatting has plenty of drawbacks and cannot be a substitute for real world human interaction. Firstly, those who like to chat online spend less time outdoors or in social settings and may lose their social skills. Secondly, Internet chatting can be addictive. Users may forget about their work or ignore their family and friends. Thirdly, you cannot see the person you are talking to, so people can lie about who they are. Users should never believe everything they are told in a chat&#160;room.</p><p>However, many people prefer chatting to others online. They&#160;say that the main advantage of online chatting is that it allows users to pose a question and to receive an instant response. Internet chatting helps people stay in touch with their friends without leaving home. Besides, they can chat to lots of people from all over the world and complete other tasks at the same&#160;time.</p><p>Anyway, if you are doing something else while chatting to your friends, you are not giving the other person your full attention. It&#160;is much better to talk to your friend face to face because then you can see his face and hear his&#160;voice.</p><p>To conclude, the increase in online chatting results in more efficient communication.</p><p>Nevertheless, at the same time it leads to a decrease in communication skills. I&#160;strongly believe that virtual friends are not equal to real-life friends.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a86">Some people prefer writing traditional paper letters to using e-mail</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>In the past, people had to go to the post office to send a letter. Today, communication technology enables us to contact anyone, from anywhere, and at an instant. However, have traditional letters become obsolete?</p><p>In my opinion, e-mails have loads of advantages. First of all, they can be sent instantly, which helps us save our time. Secondly, one can send the same message to many people simultaneously. What&#160;is more, e-mail is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than sending traditional letters because one does not need paper, stamps or envelopes to send messages by computer.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that paper letters enable them to express their thoughts and feelings. E-mails are often impersonal and short, while paper letters are thoughtful and long. E-mails do not allow you to see the sender&#8217;s handwriting and to feel the crisp paper. In&#160;addition, if you do not have access to the Internet, you will not be able to send e-mail.</p><p>Anyway, the post office may be closed when you need to buy stamps and envelopes. If&#160;you have a computer with an Internet connection, you will be able to send a message from anywhere, 24&#160;hours a day and 7&#160;days a&#160;week.</p><p>To conclude, sending e-mail has almost taken the place of writing letters. Writing</p><p>e-mails does not take as much time and energy as writing traditional letters. I&#160;think that if you want to tell your loved ones an interesting piece of news, it may be better to write a paper letter, which has more of a personal touch; but if the addressee does not mean much to you, e-mail will&#160;do.</p> </div>

The&#160;idea of cloning is highly controversial and arouses worldwide concern. The&#160;question has arisen whether humans have the right to intervene in the creation of new&#160;life.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;do not think that it is a very good idea to clone animals and humans.</p><p>Firstly, animal cloning is expensive and highly inefficient. It&#160;is well known that more than ninety percent of cloning attempts fail. Secondly, cloned animals tend to have poor health and die early. For&#160;example, Dolly, the first animal that has been successfully cloned, died when she was six, although, the average life expectancy of a sheep is 10&#160;to 12&#160;years. Thirdly, scientists do not know how cloning could impact mental development.</p><p>However, some people believe that cloning can be beneficial. For&#160;instance, human cloning can help infertile couples to create a child. What&#160;is more, cloning could be used to repopulate endangered animal species such as the giant panda or cheetah.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that an increase in human cloning will lead to fewer adoptions. In&#160;addition, there is a popular misconception that cloned people would be perfect. As&#160;for cloning animals, I&#160;believe that it is better to preserve natural habitat and wild animal populations.</p><p>To sum up, cloning is costly and often inefficient. Besides, it has not been proven to be safe, I&#160;think that cloning can be used in medicine to replace damaged organs, but it must not be done on humans because it is potentially dangerous and ethically irresponsible.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a88">Some people are worried about computers and robots doing the same things that people can do</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The rapidly changing world of technology influences our everyday lives. Most&#160;people believe that technologies facilitate their lives and save much time; others say that we are too dependent on technology. Is&#160;there a possibility that computers and robots might become our masters instead of slaves?</p><p>In my opinion, computers and robots can be very useful. First of all, they help people perform various tasks. For&#160;example, they can explore another planet, defuse bombs, control cars and planes, explore inside a volcano or just do boring household chores like cleaning.</p><p>Secondly, the use of industrial robots has led to cheaper production of various goods, including automobiles and electronics. In&#160;addition, domestic robots provide companionship to elderly and disabled people and make their lives easier.</p><p>However, a lot of people say that the use of robots in industry results in unemployment.</p><p>Besides, some people fear that technology will take over the world or that humans will be controlled by robots.</p><p>As for me, I&#160;cannot agree with the second point of view. Science fiction gives rise to many misconceptions about robots, including the idea that robots can be a threat or that people can lose control over them. Nevertheless, this will hardly happen because robots cannot evolve independently of humans.</p><p>To conclude, the environment in which people live and work is changing, and we should keep up with the times. Technology improves our lives and brings numerous benefits to mankind. I&#160;think that we should not fear new technologies, but embrace&#160;them.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a89">Some people say that a virtual field trip can be a good alternative to a traditional field trip</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>With advances in technology, virtual field trips have become very popular. Today, students do not need to go to cities, museums or art galleries any longer because they can travel to other places through websites. However, can a virtual field trip substitute for a traditional field&#160;trip?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that virtual field trips have plenty of advantages. Firstly, they enable teachers to take their students to any place in the world in seconds. Secondly, it is easy to arrange online field trips because there is no need for buses and chaperones. Thirdly, travelling to France or Germany is expensive, and many students cannot afford to go there. Nevertheless, they can take a virtual tour to these countries for&#160;free.</p><p>On the contrary, some people say that the experience is far from real because students cannot touch things, interact with some areas or take pictures. What&#160;is more, a virtual field trip does not give students the opportunity to talk to guides and experts.</p><p>Of course, taking a virtual field trip is not the same as actually visiting a&#160;place.</p><p>Nonetheless, it gives students the chance to learn a lot of interesting things and can inspire them to visit different places in the future. In&#160;addition, many online field trips allow students to contact experts and to ask them some questions.</p><p>To conclude, virtual field trips open up a world of opportunities for both students and teachers. They&#160;allow students to travel to other cities and countries without leaving the comfort and safety of the classroom. Although virtual field trips cannot substitute for traditional field trips, I&#160;think they are a valuable supplement to traditional lessons.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a91">Some people say that the theatre is likely to disappear</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The theatre has existed since 2000&#160;BC. However, a lot of people believe that today it cannot compete with films and TV. Does&#160;that mean that the days of the theatre are&#160;over?</p><p>In my opinion, the theatre still has great appeal for many people. Firstly, a theatre performance is shown live to the audience. While watching a movie you stare at flat shades on the screen and see only recorded images. Nevertheless, in the theatre you watch living breathing people interact and see the character&#8217;s story happen right in front of&#160;you.</p><p>Secondly, a theatre performance gives you a chance to appreciate the wonderful acting of a talented cast. What&#160;is more, the theatre enables you to see your favourite actors on the&#160;stage.</p><p>Nonetheless, some people prefer watching a movie to seeing a play. Unlike the theatre performance, the film story can change time and locations with ease. Moreover, theatre tickets are expensive, and you cannot enjoy popcorn, chips and soft drinks during the&#160;play.</p><p>Anyway, if you want to watch your favourite film again, you can expect the same piece of art over and over. In&#160;the theatre, the live art differs each time. Besides, watching a film in a movie house full of other people can be very annoying, as many moviegoers talk and eat popcorn during the&#160;film.</p><p>To conclude, the theatre has a greater connection and intimacy between the actors and the audience. The&#160;fact that the houses are always full, and that often one cannot get a ticket for love nor money proves that a lot of people still love the theatre. I&#160;strongly believe that the theatre will never disappear.</p> </div>

Some&#160;people enjoy examining graffiti, while others look down on writing and pictures illegally placed in public spaces. The&#160;question arises whether graffiti is crime or&#160;art.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that graffiti is an art form. Firstly, it gives artists an opportunity to communicate their feelings and ideas to the audience and to show that art is not only what appears in galleries or museums. Secondly, a lot of pictures are colourful and complex. The&#160;completion of some paintings takes plenty of time and effort as well as a considerable amount of skill. What&#160;is more, graffiti is a creative method of communicating with other artists and the average citizen.</p><p>However, some people do not recognize graffiti as art. They&#160;say that most pictures are unsightly and have little or no aesthetic appeal. In&#160;addition, graffiti often appears on private or public property without permission, and then public funds are used to remove&#160;it.</p><p>I agree that not all pictures on walls and trains are good examples of the art&#160;form.</p><p>Nevertheless, some paintings are really beautifully done. Besides, I&#160;believe that graffiti often beautifies urban spaces and makes walls and buildings look attractive.</p><p>To conclude, today, one can see graffiti in galleries, museums, on many websites, in fashionable magazines, and even on clothes and toys. It&#160;brings an aesthetic pleasure to the general public like any other recognized art form. I&#160;believe that graffiti has a great future.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a93">Some people believe that dancing can be of great benefit to children</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some parents want their children to begin dancing at an early age. Many&#160;adults believe that dancing is a fun way to improve kids&#8217; health and fitness levels; others say that taking dance classes requires much effort from children. The&#160;question arises whether the experience is really rewarding for&#160;kids.</p><p>In my opinion, dancing is important for children. Firstly, dance makes them strong and healthy and helps them burn calories. Secondly, dance promotes discipline. Children learn to follow instructions and keep practicing in order to succeed. As&#160;a result, they become persevering and learn how to achieve their goals, which can be applied to schoolwork or any other area of their lives. What&#160;is more, children who take dance classes learn to cooperate with their partners and to work as a&#160;team.</p><p>However, some people say that dancing can be an expensive hobby because parents</p><p>have to pay for costumes and private lessons. In&#160;addition, not every child is equally good at dancing. If&#160;children understand that their peers are more successful and talented than they are, they may lose confidence in their abilities and feel depressed.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that healthy competition is important for children&#8217;s development. Besides, dancing is not only about competition. Most&#160;kids dance simply for enjoyment and exercise.</p><p>To conclude, children who dance are usually active, strong, self-confident, and</p><p>self-disciplined. Dance teaches kids to express themselves creatively and makes them feel happier. I&#160;think that dancing is a wonderful way to exercise while having&#160;fun.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a95">Some people believe that listening to music has good effects on everyone</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Music is loved all over the world, and it can affect the way people feel and behave. Music is said to have a lot of benefits, but it can also have negative effects. The&#160;question arises whether all musical genres are equally beneficial to listeners.</p><p>I believe that listening to either upbeat or relaxing music can have positive effects. Firstly, music helps you relax and eases anxiety. It&#160;is well known that music can have a calming effect on listeners, but it can also give them energy. Secondly, music can challenge us intellectually. People listening to music tend to feel more creative in the task they are doing such as writing, painting or even cleaning the house. Moreover, music can have a healing effect on people. It&#160;can normalize heart rate, stimulate the brain and soothe listeners better than any&#160;pills.</p><p>However, some people say that certain forms of music can have a negative influence on listeners. For&#160;example, rock music and heavy metal arouse anger, irritation and rage, which can lead to aggressive behaviour. Some&#160;popular song lyrics contain violent, racist and suicidal themes. In&#160;addition, those who listen to music at high volumes may suffer from hearing&#160;loss.</p><p>Anyway, listening to music that inspires you and makes you feel happier and more energetic helps you create the mood you really want. Nobody can force you to listen to music that you do not like or that is too&#160;loud.</p><p>To sum up, we should never underestimate the power and influence of music. It&#160;can change your mood, bring back memories and touch your feelings. I&#160;think that listening to music is an exciting and fulfilling experience.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a96">Some people think that rap music has a bad influence on teenagers</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, rap music is very popular and influences television, fashion, dance and other musical styles. Many&#160;people are worried about the messages conveyed by rap&#160;music.</p><p>However, do the negatives of rap music really outweigh its benefits?</p><p>In my opinion, rap music is not as bad as most people think. Firstly, it educates listeners about what is going on in a neighbourhood or city and draws their attention to different problems, including poverty and racism. Rap&#160;music enables young people to tell stories so that they can be heard. Secondly, rap music can be used to reach students and to make learning more interesting. Last&#160;but not least, rap music is good for dancing.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that teenagers should not be allowed to listen to rap music. Firstly, the lyrics of many rap music songs glamorize drugs, promiscuity, crime and violence. Therefore, teenagers who listen to rap are more likely to drink, use drugs and commit violent acts. Secondly, rap songs often contain inappropriate or offensive language, which has a negative effect on teenagers&#8217; vocabulary.</p><p>Anyway, not all rap music is negative. Some&#160;rap artists focus on delivering positive messages and educating their listeners. I&#160;believe that rap music can be used as a tool to speak out against violence and discrimination and to promote peace and tolerance.</p><p>To conclude, teenagers need to explore different musical genres in order to broaden their musical horizons and to be more open-minded. Listening to rap music can help young people relax or feel more creative. If&#160;teenagers like rap music, it is better to focus on positive themes than to ban them from listening to&#160;it.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a97">Some people say that they are used to working or studying to the sound of music</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people always have their favourite records on while they work or study. They&#160;simply cannot imagine their working day without music. However, is it a good idea to listen to music and to work at the same&#160;time?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;like listening to music while I&#160;do my homework or perform other&#160;tasks.</p><p>First of all, listening to music increases my concentration and helps me to organize my thoughts and focus on a particular task. Secondly, listening to music makes even the most boring jobs more enjoyable. What&#160;is more, listening to music that I&#160;enjoy can improve my mood and help to reduce stress.</p><p>Nevertheless, music can be a distraction for some people. Some&#160;need total silence to be able to work or read. If&#160;there is any background noise, they get distracted and annoyed. In&#160;addition, some people say that music can impair the ability to memorize and recall information. Therefore, silence is important in any space used for learning.</p><p>Anyway, some types of music are enjoyable without being distracting. Your&#160;favourite music can create a pleasant environment for learning and increase your productivity. Music can also have a calming effect and promote rapid and focused&#160;work.</p><p>To conclude, the beneficial effects of music should not be underestimated. Listening to soothing music or music with a positive message makes you happier and helps you to get through dull work. If&#160;you experiment with different musical genres, you may eventually discover what type of music works best for&#160;you.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a99">Some people think that watching movies is beneficial to everybody</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Everybody likes watching films. Movies are a source of entertainment for people of all age groups and professions. However, is watching a movie the best way to spend your free&#160;time?</p><p>In my opinion, watching movies can be a very useful activity. Firstly, films introduce us to cultures, historical events and stories with which we are unfamiliar. Secondly, movies stir our emotions and memories. What&#160;is more, movies can be used in classrooms to enhance learning.</p><p>For example, watching the original version of a foreign movie is an effective way of improving one&#8217;s language skills.</p><p>On the contrary, some people say that watching movies can interfere with basic physical activity. People who spend too many hours in front of a television have little time for exercise and outdoor activities. In&#160;addition, watching a movie is a one-sided activity. People look at the screen and do not look at each other during the film. They&#160;dip into exciting adventures of the main characters and do not pay attention to what their friends or family members do or&#160;say.</p><p>Nevertheless, I&#160;believe that films can stimulate conversations. Movies can also bring families together.</p><p>Family movie night is a fun activity that encourages parents and children to spend more time together and to discuss different things.</p><p>To sum up, watching movies is many people&#8217;s favourite pastime these days, and it will remain popular for years to come. Of&#160;course, not all films are worth seeing, and the amount of time you spend in front of a screen should be limited. Anyway, I&#160;believe that a really good film has the power to entertain, educate and unite people.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a100">Some people are fond of 3D films</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>3D films are growing in popularity. Many&#160;people think that watching a 3D movie is great fun, while others prefer 2D versions. The&#160;question arises whether 3D films are really worth seeing.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;enjoy watching 3D movies. The&#160;main advantage of such films is that the image is seen in three dimensions. 3D movies recreate reality with greater detail and enhance the illusion of depth perception. Secondly, 3D movies prove that the technology can enhance not only the visual experience, but the storytelling, too. Besides, now many people can watch 3D films from the comfort of their living rooms instead of having to go to a movie&#160;house.</p><p>However, some people believe that 3D does not add much value to the film. They&#160;say that 3D movies are made for amusement rather than for aesthetic pleasure. Another disadvantage of 3D films is that tickets are expensive. Some&#160;moviegoers say that 3D films are not worth the extra cost and that they are just a way for companies to boost profits.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that a good 3D movie is worth seeing. Watching 3D movies gives us a wonderful opportunity to interact more with the film. People perceive the world around them with depth. Therefore, it is natural to see films that are given more depth to the scene instead of flat images.</p><p>To conclude, modern technology enables filmmakers to create magic on screen. 3D films bring the movie-going experience to a completely new level. Some&#160;3D movies are very impressive on a technical level and are definitely worth the time and&#160;cost.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a102">Some people prefer watching a film version to reading a book</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>In the past, when the forms of entertainment were far more limited reading was one of the few ways to pass the time, but that was before the advent of new technologies. These days, people have a lot of other options for spending time, so many of them prefer watching movies or playing computer games to reading books. Will&#160;DVDs take the place of books in the future?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;prefer reading a good book to watching its film version. Firstly, reading helps me relax and forget about my problems. It&#160;often relieves stress and makes me feel happier. Secondly, reading fires my imagination. Books transfer me to other countries, continents or even to other worlds, introduce me to amazing people and make me laugh and cry. Moreover, reading helps me improve my vocabulary and teaches me to&#160;focus.</p><p>However, finding time for reading can be difficult for people with busy schedules and hectic lifestyles. Unlike reading, watching a movie does not involve a major investment of time. Besides, watching a film is easier because you do not have to use your imagination.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that no screen version can be better than a book itself. Any&#160;movie director adds a little bit of himself to the film and sometimes changes the story completely. Therefore, even if the movie is well done, it differs from the&#160;book.</p><p>To conclude, I&#160;think that reading is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment and a healthy means of escapism. Books allow the reader to &#8216;talk&#8217; to people who lived in different ages and countries. I&#160;believe that no film can substitute for this special silent conversation.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a103">Some people say that electronic books are going to replace paper books in the future</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Nowadays, much new information is not printed in traditional books, but is made available online or in the form of e-books. Electronic books are making their way into the world&#8217;s markets. The&#160;question has arisen whether the paper book will go away and be replaced by an electronic version.</p><p>In my opinion, e-books have some advantages over traditional books. Firstly, e-readers are light, compact and can store thousands of pages. You&#160;can carry a single device instead of a suitcase full of heavy books. Secondly, e-readers allow you to call up a dictionary and to increase the font size when the light is dim. Thirdly, e-books save trees and the energy and resources that it takes to print paper&#160;books.</p><p>However, some people prefer traditional paper editions to e-books. They&#160;say that the device for reading e-books is rather expensive, and one needs access to the Internet to download them. What&#160;is more, so far there is only a limited selection of e-books being published.</p><p>Anyway, e-books are cheaper than traditional books. Consequently, an e-reader could save you money in the long run. Besides, more and more titles are available as e-books today. Publishers try to keep pace with an expanding number of readers who want the latest technology and continue to put out e-books at a steady&#160;pace.</p><p>To conclude, the main advantages of e-books are their convenience and cost. They&#160;enable people to carry a virtual library anywhere and to buy more books for less money. Although e-books are relatively new, there is every chance that they will become more popular than traditional books in the future.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a104">Some people say that we do not need public libraries any more</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, public libraries are not as popular as they were some years ago. Some&#160;people say that the library is not likely to survive in a time of change. The&#160;question arises whether public libraries have a future in an Internet&#160;Age.</p><p>I think public libraries offer plenty of benefits to readers. Firstly, they lend books, magazines, CDs, DVDs and other items for free to anyone with a library card. Secondly, a library offers a quiet study environment to those who want to read a book or complete their coursework. Moreover, libraries offer additional services, including reading programs, story</p><p>hours, classes and free Internet access.</p><p>However, a lot of people prefer surfing the Internet to using libraries. They&#160;say that the Internet eliminates the need to go to the library and saves much time and effort. Besides, library members must return books by the due date and cannot retain them for future reference.</p><p>Anyway, public libraries are for those who do not have access to the Internet, cannot afford to purchase books and magazines, need material that no individual can be expected to have, or require professional assistance with their research. Besides, the information that people find online may not be as in depth as the information from books available at a public library.</p><p>To conclude, for many people the library is not only a place where they can borrow books. It&#160;is also a place where they can study or work, learn something new, think, relax, read a newspaper and meet like-minded people. That&#160;is why I&#160;believe that public libraries are not likely to disappear.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a105">Some people say that reading detective stories is just a waste of time</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Detective stories have always been extremely popular with the reading public. This&#160;literary genre appeals to the reader's desire to be entertained, to uncover clues and to solve puzzles. However, are detective stories really worth reading?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;enjoy reading detective stories. Firstly, most detective stories are interesting because they arouse the reader&#8217;s curiosity and keep them in suspense. Secondly, a good detective story is a battle of wits between the author and the reader. It&#160;allows the reader to solve the crime on their own by using the clues that are placed throughout the story. Thirdly, many people read detective stories for diversion and relaxation. Some&#160;stories are designed to be read in one sitting.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that they get bored with detective stories. Firstly, all these stories are the same: a crime, usually a murder, has been committed, and the detective must figure out who did it. Besides, sometimes the reader can figure out the culprit from the very beginning.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that a well-crafted detective story deserves the reader&#8217;s attention.</p><p>Reading detective stories develops your critical thinking and analytical skills and allows you to exercise your brain and to test your observation skills.</p><p>In conclusion, I&#160;would like to say that reading detective stories is a pleasurable activity. You&#160;will be able to enjoy multiple plot twists and to try to unravel the mystery. I&#160;believe that a good detective story will hold your attention right to the very&#160;end.</p> </div>

Those who are determined to lose weight often go on a diet. However, is it really a good idea to limit the amount of food that you eat to get thinner?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;am against weight loss diets. Firstly, insufficient intake of nutrients and vitamins can weaken the immune system and cause fatigue, irritability and lack of energy. Secondly, dieting can result in such eating disorders as anorexia or bulimia. Moreover, following a weight loss diet can be difficult for people with busy schedules. They&#160;always seem to eat on the run and have no time to prepare healthy&#160;food.</p><p>Nevertheless, a lot of people follow weight loss diets because their main advantage is quick weight loss. Carrying extra weight puts a person at risk of developing many diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease. The&#160;faster people lose weight, the sooner they can get rid of health problems. Another advantage of weight loss diets is that your face and body will look much better after losing weight.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that quick weight loss is bad for your health. It&#160;lowers a person&#8217;s metabolism and causes their bodies to use their muscles and organs for energy. Besides, the faster you lose weight, the more likely you are to gain it&#160;back.</p><p>To conclude, the fact that you are getting thinner does not mean that you are getting healthier. You&#160;may have serious problems if you try to force it and lose weight too quickly. You&#160;should do it slowly and sensibly.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a108">Some people say that it is important to exercise regularly</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Everybody wants to be in good shape, to stay healthy and to enjoy good physical, mental and emotional health. Physical activity is important for healthy development. However, if exercise is good for us, why is not everyone doing&#160;it?</p><p>In my opinion, exercise has plenty of benefits. First of all, physical exercise strengthens the immune system, decreases your body weight and helps to prevent many diseases, including heart and cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Secondly, exercise makes you strong, fast, patient and disciplined. What&#160;is more, regular exercise can help improve your mood and increase energy levels. It&#160;is the best remedy for depression and stress.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people do not exercise for various reasons. Some&#160;of them are afraid to injure themselves or think that if they exercise too much, fatigue may interfere with other activities. In&#160;addition, exercise can be expensive if you go to fitness clubs and swimming&#160;pools.</p><p>Anyway, if you warm up, follow safety rules and use equipment correctly, you will hardly receive an injury. Besides, you do not have to pay a fortune for exercising, but look for cheaper alternatives. If&#160;money is tight, you can walk, jog, bike, swim, dance or do your morning exercises.</p><p>To sum up, if you want to lose weight, to increase your life span and to feel happier and more energetic, you should exercise regularly. Physical activity is important for your overall health and well-being. I&#160;am convinced that a moderate amount of exercise is good for everyone.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a109">Some people say that extreme sports are too risky</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The popularity of extreme sports has grown a lot over the last few decades. Extreme sports like surfing, rock climbing, parachuting, mountain biking, scuba diving or bungee jumping are thrilling and adventurous. However, are they worth the risk involved?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that extreme sports are not for everyone. First of all, they involve a high level of danger. There is a risk that your gear may fail and you may receive serious injuries. Secondly, extreme sports involve vigorous physical exertion and require strength, endurance and a strong mental attitude. What&#160;is more, you will need a certain amount of money to pay for highly specialized gear and a professional instructor.</p><p>Nevertheless, some avid thrill seekers say that extreme sports get the adrenaline going and allow them to test their survival skills, to compete against nature and to overcome their fears. In&#160;addition, extreme sports enable a participant to relieve stress and to break the monotony of everyday life. Those who are involved in extreme sports say that the experience is magical.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;do not think anything is worth the risk of injuring yourself or losing your life. Some&#160;extreme sports are so dangerous that people compare them with virtual suicide.</p><p>In conclusion, I&#160;would like to say that extreme sports are not for the faint-hearted.</p><p>They require more athletic ability and courage than ordinary sports. I&#160;think that those who are involved in extreme sports often dice with death in order to experience both fear and pleasure.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a110">Some people believe that children should be encouraged to go in for sports</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Regular exercise has a lot of health benefits. That&#160;is the main reason why many parents want their kids to go in for sports. However, are sports activities really important for children?</p><p>I think that kids should do sports regularly. Firstly, physical exercise strengthens the immune system, improves mental health and helps prevent different diseases and obesity. Secondly, sports can teach kids how to work as a team. Children learn to cooperate with their peers and to be responsible for their actions. Additionally, playing sports gives kids the opportunity to meet new friends and shows them that exercise can be&#160;fun.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that playing sports can have some negative effects on children. Not&#160;every child is equally good at sports. If&#160;children&#8217;s parents, coaches or peers constantly criticize them, kids may lose confidence in their abilities and feel depressed.</p><p>Apart from that, children may suffer different injuries, including scratches, sprains and fractures.</p><p>Anyway, sports teach children how to deal with defeat. Children learn that winning is not everything and that sometimes it is OK to lose. Failure can encourage kids to keep practicing their skills in order to perfect them. As&#160;a result, children become persevering and learn how to achieve their goals, which can be applied to schoolwork or any other area of their lives. Besides, if children warm up, follow safety rules and wear protective gear, they will hardly receive an injury.</p><p>To conclude, the benefits of youth sports far outweigh the negative effects. Sports improve physical and psychological health, and they are a good source of entertainment. I&#160;think that sports can make children happier and boost their confidence.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a111">Some people dream of becoming professional athletes</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Those who do sports often have ambitions of becoming professional athletes. They&#160;believe it will bring them fame, fortune and prestige. However, is the life of a professional athlete as wonderful as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that professional athletes face numerous problems. Firstly, they often suffer both minor and serious injuries, including sprains, torn muscles, broken limbs, and head and spinal injuries. Secondly, many professional athletes train too hard and put extreme pressure on their bodies. Overtraining sometimes results in an inability to recover. In&#160;addition, some professional athletes use drugs to improve their performance.</p><p>Performance-enhancing drugs may cause headaches, result in depression and a mental breakdown or even lead to&#160;death.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that the career of a professional athlete can bring you status, power and wealth. Professional athletes get paid a lot of money for doing what they love. What&#160;is more, sportsmen are always in good shape and enjoy good physical, mental and emotional health.</p><p>Anyway, it is difficult to reach the top-paying positions in any sport. Moreover, even though professional athletes are passionate about sports and may earn high wages, their lives are very hard. They&#160;have to spend a huge amount of time developing and maintaining</p><p>their skills. In&#160;addition, they often have to practice when they do not feel like training.</p><p>To conclude, the career of a professional athlete requires a lot of effort, time and commitment. Nonetheless, it usually lasts only several years due to injuries or age. I&#160;believe that doing sports is highly beneficial to health, but I&#160;would prefer to play sports for recreation and enjoyment.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a112">Some people say that one should go to a fitness club to be healthy and slim</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Everybody knows that exercise is one of the key components of a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Regular exercise leads to weight loss, improved cardiovascular health and muscle growth. However, is it a good idea to go to a fitness club in the pursuit of health and beauty?</p><p>In my opinion, fitness clubs have plenty of benefits. Firstly, health clubs offer a wide variety of cardio equipment and weight machines. Besides, they provide you with fitness related activities, including aerobics, yoga and swimming. Secondly, you can hire a personal trainer who will help you design an exercise plan with the right combination of cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. In&#160;addition, exercising in the company of fellow enthusiasts motivates you and increases the efficiency of your workouts.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people cannot afford to go to fitness clubs. Besides, one needs at least thirty minutes of exercise three times a week. People with busy schedules cannot do as much as that and choose not to join a&#160;gym.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that you can fit your workout into your busy schedule if you want to. For&#160;example, if you often stay late at the office or have got a lot to do in the evening, you can get up an hour earlier in the morning to go to the&#160;gym.</p><p>To sum up, fitness clubs help people stay in shape. Those who go to the gym are more energetic, physically stronger and have better endurance. If&#160;you make your workout a regular part of your week, you will be able to enjoy the benefits of exercise.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a113">Some people think that surfing is rather risky</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Every year millions of people go to the beach in order to ride a surfboard on the crest of a wave. Surfing is growing in popularity as more and more people across the world want to engage in this sport. However, is surfing for everyone?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;see no reason why young people should not go surfing. Firstly, it gives them an opportunity to release stress and to display their strength and agility. Secondly, surfing makes them stronger and healthier because this sport engages the entire body, so there is plenty of movement. What&#160;is more, riding a surfboard gets the adrenaline pumping in your body and makes you feel happier.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that surfing can be incredibly dangerous and that surfers put themselves at risk every day. Encounters with sea life and collisions*with sand bars, rocks, reefs or other surfboards can cause injuries. The&#160;risk of drowning and the risk of being attacked by a shark can make this sport deadly. In&#160;addition, the equipment and sportswear are expensive.</p><p>Anyway, surfers say that their hobby does not take much money because all you need is a good board and a pair of shorts. Besides, most sea life is harmless, and shark attacks are quite&#160;rare.</p><p>To conclude, the very thought of riding a big wave fills most people with&#160;dread.</p><p>Nonetheless, to some, surfing is a highly addictive and satisfying sport that allows them to experience an adrenaline rush and to feel alive. I&#160;believe that riding on waves is a thrilling experience, and one may quickly find out why so many people become obsessed with surfing.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a114">Some people think that parkour is not for everybody</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, parkour is the fastest-growing sport in the world. It&#160;is well known that parkour is not only exciting but also dangerous. So&#160;is it a good idea to practice parkour?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that young people can gain plenty of benefits from parkour. Firstly, it teaches them to move quickly and to overcome obstacles like concrete walls, high fences, hedges or rocks. Secondly, parkour gives you much energy and helps you develop physical</p><p>fitness and coordination. You&#160;learn to control your body and to trust yourself. What&#160;is more, parkour teaches you to surmount everyday difficulties and to approach problems differently.</p><p>However, some people say that parkour involves a high level of danger. If&#160;you assume too much about your physical abilities and do not take full account of the risks, you may be seriously injured. For&#160;example, your may fall and break your leg or arm. In&#160;addition, practitioners of parkour may accidentally hurt bystanders.</p><p>Anyway, if you are a beginner, you can look for a gym with soft pads where you can practice without getting hurt. Alternatively, you can pick an environment with obstacles that are not too challenging. One&#160;should remember that parkour requires prudence and good self-control.</p><p>To conclude, parkour is not just a sport, but an art and a way of life, which makes it so popular and appealing. Parkour makes you strong and agile and helps you develop speed and power. I&#160;think that the main advantage of parkour is that it gives you the opportunity to explore the potential offered by your&#160;body.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a115">Some people think that physical attractiveness is important for everyone</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Modern society places much emphasis on physical beauty. Attractive people seem to be at an advantage no matter what they do or where they go. Does&#160;the world really revolve around beautiful people?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;believe that inner beauty is much more important than outer beauty and that sometimes-physical attractiveness may be a disadvantage. First of all, a pretty face and a slim figure are superficial things. Beauty begins to fade, as people grow older. Secondly, sometimes-beautiful people cannot find love because they think that other people start dating them just because of their looks. In&#160;addition, beautiful people have a reputation for being capricious, frivolous and faithless.</p><p>However, some people think that beauty is the path to happiness. Beautiful people can easily find friends and have increased romantic opportunities. Besides, it is easier for an attractive person to gain promotion or to get a well-paid&#160;job.</p><p>Nevertheless, I&#160;still believe that beauty does not guarantee happiness or a successful career. Even&#160;beautiful people can be repulsive if they lack the internal depths to support their slim figure and attractive features. Anyway, if you are kind, smart, cheerful, honest and generous, people will want to be around&#160;you.</p><p>To conclude, this is a misconception that beautiful people are happier, more successful and more satisfied with their lives. Most&#160;people agree that what lies inside is more important than what lies outside. I&#160;think that we should learn to appreciate inner beauty and remember that &#8216;all that glitters is not gold&#8217;.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a116">Some people think that plastic surgery can help them to become more attractive and happier</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, plastic surgery is very popular, with more and more men and women seeking to correct their flaws or to take years off their apparent age. It&#160;is widely believed that plastic surgery helps to improve physical features and to achieve a picture-perfect&#160;look.</p><p>However, is it a good idea to go under the knife for aesthetic reasons?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;am against plastic surgery. Firstly, it carries the risk of infection.</p><p>Secondly, plastic surgery has such negative effects as allergic reactions, the body&#8217;s rejection of an implant, post-operation pains, excessive blood loss and many others. Some&#160;people have died after cosmetic surgery or suffered disfigurement and scarring as a result of plastic surgery gone wrong. What&#160;is more, patients may be dissatisfied with the surgery.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that plastic surgery has physical and psychological benefits. Firstly, most patients look much better after the procedure. Secondly, successful plastic surgery can boost a patient&#8217;s self-esteem and confidence. A&#160;person who likes his body is more likely to go out and form relationships.</p><p>Anyway, it is important to remember that surgeons can never guarantee 100-percent success. Besides, adjusting to the change in your appearance can be difficult for both you&#160;and</p><p>your loved&#160;ones.</p><p>To conclude, one should think about all the possible risks before making the final decision to have plastic surgery. It&#160;will hardly fix your life or solve your problems. That&#160;is why I&#160;think that plastic surgery should be used only to repair a physical deformity or to help people who have been in some kind of accident.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a118">Some people prefer to have only one child</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The lifestyle of the modern family has changed greatly. Some&#160;people think that maintaining a small family size has some personal and economic advantages; others still prefer to have large families. However, is it a good idea to have two or more children these&#160;days?</p><p>In my opinion, having a small family offers many social and financial advantages. Firstly, one needs less money to support a small family. In&#160;small families, parents do not have to work too much, and they can spend more time with their child. Secondly, a large number of children create a considerable amount of chores for parents, especially for the mother. Additionally, constant battles between siblings are common in large families.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that large families are better. Firstly, when there are two or more children in the family, they become used to helping each other and sharing responsibilities. They&#160;learn to live in a &#8216;community&#8217; where every member is equal. Secondly, when a child has brothers and sisters, he or she is not likely to become egotistic because parents share their love and attention between all their children.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that in large families it is difficult to ensure that each child receives the attention he or she deserves. Parents often try to divide their time equally between their children, but it is hard to be&#160;fair.</p><p>To conclude, all families should be free to have as many children as they&#160;want.</p><p>Nonetheless, today more and more people feel that one child is the ideal family size. I&#160;think that if social support to families is not increased, one-child families may become the new traditional family.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a119">Some couples choose not to have children</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>It used to be normal practice to have a house full of children. Nowadays, a lot of young people say that they would prefer to live a childfree lifestyle. However, will they be happy with their decision?</p><p>In my opinion, the advantages of being a parent outweigh the disadvantages. Firstly, having a child is a wonderful experience for many people. Baby's first steps, games, picnics, children&#8217;s birthday parties and story reading are happy memories that every parent&#160;has.</p><p>Secondly, those with children usually find themselves surrounded by a strong support network. Children usually care for their aging parents and help them when they need it. Additionally, those who have kids are not likely to feel lonely.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people choose to be childfree for various reasons. Firstly, they will have an opportunity to build a career and to work as much as they need to. They&#160;will be free to focus on their interests, to socialize with their friends, to travel and to do whatever they want. Secondly, some couples say that they cannot afford a&#160;child.</p><p>Anyway, a lot of people manage to combine a career and family. They&#160;say that having kids does not prevent them from going on vacation or taking up a hobby. Besides, though raising a child can be expensive, many parents do not care about&#160;money.</p><p>To sum up, there is a strong emotional bond between parents and their children. Of&#160;course, having kids means being responsible, making sacrifices, worrying about your children and scheduling your life around them. Nonetheless, I&#160;still believe that the joys of parenthood more than compensate for all the difficulties that parents have to overcome.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a120">Some people choose to build a family through adoptions</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, a growing number of men and women are willing to adopt. Adopting a child can be a wonderful thing, but it is also a big decision. The&#160;question arises whether adoption is really a rewarding experience.</p><p>In my opinion, adoption has many positive aspects. First of all, it gives children a chance to grow up in a loving and caring family. Secondly, adoption allows infertile couples to raise a child. What&#160;is more, some women decide not to terminate the unwanted pregnancy because they can put the baby up for adoption.</p><p>However, some people say that there are some reasons not to adopt a child. Firstly, adopted children may have great difficulty in adjusting to their new home. They&#160;may be predisposed to drug and alcohol problems as well as to behavioural problems, or they may have poor health or emotional wounds. In&#160;addition, adoption is a long, complicated and sometimes expensive process.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that if parents give all their love and attention to an adopted child, he or she will gradually learn to trust them and to live in a new family. Besides, guardians may be eligible for a variety of government benefits.</p><p>In conclusion, I&#160;would like to say that adoption benefits the birth mother, the child and adoptive parents. It&#160;gives people a chance to have the family they have dreamed of for a long time. I&#160;believe that every child and adult needs to love and to be&#160;loved.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a121">These days, some people adopt children from overseas</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Millions of children around the world need new homes and loving parents.</p><p>International adoption is increasing in popularity. However, is it a good idea to adopt internationally instead of domestically?</p><p>I think there are many advantages of adopting a child from another country. Firstly, international adoption can give children opportunities that are not available to them in their home countries. Another major advantage of international adoption is that birth parents seldom challenge the adoption. Additionally, those who adopt a child from abroad learn more about another country and gain respect for its culture.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that there can be a lot of problems with adopting a child from another country. Firstly, international adoption is a lengthy and expensive process.</p><p>Secondly, children that are adopted from other countries may have more health problems than domestically adopted children. Some&#160;of them suffer from malnutrition or have emotional disorders or developmental disabilities. Besides, orphanages are filled with children in one&#8217;s home country.</p><p>Anyway, many people choose to adopt internationally since there is more demand than supply within the country for adoptions. The&#160;fact that more children are available for adoption means that there is no competition for the same child with other prospective adoptive parents. In&#160;some countries, the need for adoption is so great that families who want to adopt a child are offered shorter processing times and reduced&#160;fees.</p><p>To conclude, international adoption gives children a chance to find a loving home. At&#160;the same time, it enables adoptive parents to expand diversity in their family. In&#160;my opinion, raising a child adopted from abroad is an enriching multicultural experience for the family.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a122">Some people believe that adult children should not live with their parents</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>In theory, when children grow up, they begin to live independently. In&#160;practice, many young people never leave home. However, is it all right for parents and their adult children to live together?</p><p>In my opinion, adult children should live on their own. First of all, those who live with their parents may never acquire independent living skills and never stop depending on their parents. Secondly, most adult children cannot live by their own rules while they reside in their parents&#8217; home. For&#160;example, they cannot make financial decisions or invite their friends without their parents&#8217; consent. What&#160;is more, parents may face financial problems when their grown-up child lives with&#160;them.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that adult children should not leave home. Firstly, high house rents and costs make it difficult for young people to obtain their own apartment. If&#160;adult children live with their parents, they can save a lot of money. Additionally, living together gives young people and their parents an opportunity to enrich their relationships.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that a grown-up child may feel a bit of a failure if they have to live at their parents' home. Besides, disagreements about lifestyle, money and chores can put a strain on the relationship between parents and adult children. Young people want their privacy and independence, but their parents might not understand.</p><p>To conclude, these days, young people leave home sooner than their counterparts a generation ago. Those who live on their own become mature and responsible adults. I&#160;believe that children&#8217;s job is to try their wings and parents&#8217; job is to let them fly&#160;away.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a123">Some people think that couples should not marry young</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, there are numerous arguments about marriage, particularly young marriage. The&#160;average age at which men and women marry has risen, but some young people still decide to marry right out of high school. However, is it sensible to tie the knot at a young&#160;age?</p><p>In my opinion, there are many pitfalls associated with early marriage. Firstly, those who choose to marry young often lack the maturity to understand many things and do not know what they want to achieve in the future. For&#160;example, one member of the couple may choose a career that requires a lot of travelling, which may have a bad effect on their marriage. Secondly, young people often face financial difficulties that can put a huge strain on their relationship. Moreover, as the years pass young people may find that they have very little in common and that their needs, goals and views have become completely different.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that early marriage has some benefits. Firstly, marriage provides stability in a relationship and brings young people closer emotionally. Additionally, young people can easily adjust to having new relatives and adapt to living in a new apartment or another&#160;city.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that lack of maturity and social experience may complicate the relationship with in-laws and lead to disagreements.</p><p>To sum up, statistics show that a majority of young marriages fail. Financial difficulties and young people&#8217;s reluctance to compromise, to make sacrifices and to give up on their dreams for the sake of the family may result in divorce. People should be prepared for family commitments if they want their marriage to&#160;last.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a124">Some people say that it is wonderful to have a sibling</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some children complain that their siblings treat them badly and make life unbearable for them. Other kids enjoy the company of their brothers and sisters and are happy to spend a lot of time with them. The&#160;question therefore arises whether having a sibling is a blessing or a&#160;curse.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that having siblings can have plenty of benefits. Firstly, siblings provide each other with mutual support, especially in times of crisis. They&#160;guide and protect each other all through their lives. Secondly, children with siblings have better social and communication skills because they are used to being around other people and having to share and compromise. What&#160;is more, those with siblings seldom feel lonely because there is always someone around to talk to, play with and go to for advice.</p><p>However, some people believe that children with siblings may face some problems.</p><p>Firstly, there is often competition between brothers and sisters for their parents' attention and love. Additionally, siblings have to share a room, toys and other things, which can lead to quarrels and fights.</p><p>Anyway, sometimes only children are more spoiled and selfish than those with siblings since they have no rivals for their parents' love. Those with siblings learn how to resolve conflicts, solve problems, share and be more tolerant towards other people.</p><p>To conclude, I&#160;think that the advantages of having siblings far outweigh the disadvantages. Brothers and sisters develop strong emotional bonds and care about each other. Though siblings sometimes quarrel and have to share everything, including their parents' attention and time, they have a lot of fun together.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a125">Some people believe that grandparents should take an active part in their grandchildren&#8217;s upbringing</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some children spend little time with their grandparents, particularly if they live far away. As&#160;a result, kids are unable to get to know their grandparents and to bond with them. However, is it good for children to grow up without their grandparents?</p><p>I think that old people should be involved in their grandchildren&#8217;s upbringing. Firstly, some parents cannot afford or just do not want to leave their child with a babysitter. Most&#160;grandparents willingly agree to look after their grandchildren while parents are&#160;busy.</p><p>Secondly, old people often help their grandchildren with their schoolwork, which improves the child&#8217;s learning skills. Additionally, it is easier for some children to tell their grandparents about personal things. Old&#160;people have a lot of experience and wisdom and can give kids good advice.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that grandparents may have a very different idea about raising kids than parents do. Their views, attitudes and moral values may differ from those parents are trying to teach their child, which can result in confusion and disagreements within the family. Besides, old people are often in poor health and it is difficult for them to look after&#160;kids.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that it is very important for both children and their grandparents to create a close relationship. Children who spend much time with their grandparents learn how to resolve conflicts and become more tolerant towards other people.</p><p>To conclude, having loving grandparents is what every child wants. Old&#160;people are willing to make sacrifices for their grandchildren and often put the child&#8217;s needs before their own. Grandparents who are involved in their grandchildren&#8217;s upbringing feel younger and happier.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a127">Some people say that overpopulation is a major problem for the human race</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>At present, the Earth accommodates more than 6&#160;billion people. Some&#160;people are worried that the planet will not be able to sustain larger numbers of inhabitants. However, can population growth have positive effects?</p><p>In my opinion, overpopulation can cause a lot of problems. Firstly, if the world&#8217;s population continues growing, it will be very difficult to produce enough food and goods. More&#160;people need more water, minerals, shelter and clothes. Secondly, population growth causes numerous environmental problems. People drive cars, throw away litter, cut down forests and consume natural resources. Moreover, overpopulation may result in the emergence of new epidemics and conflict over scarce resources.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that overpopulation has some advantages. An&#160;increase in population can lead to an increase in technology, which will result in the introduction of many innovations and the production of more sophisticated goods. Additionally, with an ever-growing population there will be more people willing to work for less money. As&#160;a result, there will be more goods and services available to people, and prices will go&#160;down.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think that overpopulation will do more harm than good to economic development. If&#160;the number of workers exceeds the number of available jobs, people will have difficulty in finding new employment, which can lead to poverty and elevated crime&#160;rate.</p><p>To conclude, if human population growth does not slow, people may face serious problems. If&#160;we want to live longer, healthier lives, it is necessary to use population control. I&#160;think that it is important to limit birth rates and educate people about family planning.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a128">Some people think that stress can ruin one&#8217;s life</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Losing a job, having difficulties at home or at work or just moving to a new flat may cause stress. Some&#160;people say that stress turns their lives upside down, while others like being under constant pressure. The&#160;question arises whether it is all right to feel stressed.</p><p>In my opinion, stress has plenty of detrimental effects. Firstly, it has a bad effect on a person's overall health. It&#160;weakens the immune system, leads to insomnia and increases the risks of heart disease. In&#160;addition, stress can cause tension, irritability, anxiety, anger and loss of concentration. Secondly, stress can interfere with one&#8217;s productivity and personal relationships. What&#160;is more, stress can trigger behaviour that is difficult to control such as compulsive gambling, overeating or spending.</p><p>However, some people believe that living without stress is like living in a vegetative state. Coping with stress makes people resilient and mentally strong. In&#160;addition, stress sometimes makes people move on and change life for the better.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that life without stress would be much happier. I&#160;think that it is important to avoid or at least to minimize stress, which has harmful effects on both mental and physical health. Long-term stress can lead to a nervous breakdown, depression or even suicide.</p><p>To sum up, stress is inevitable, and we cannot remove it from our lives. That&#160;is why it is important to find some ways to cope with stress and to remain positive. If&#160;we learn to reduce stress, we will be able to avoid many stress-related physical problems.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a129">Some people continue smoking in spite of all warnings</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Smoking has become a global problem, as it is practiced by more than 1&#160;billion people, including women and teenagers. Everybody knows that smoking is detrimental to one&#8217;s health. Then&#160;the question arises: what makes people light up a cigarette?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;am against smoking. First of all, smoking is among the leading causes of many serious diseases, including lung cancer, heart attacks and asthma. It&#160;is well known that tobacco-related diseases can cause premature death. Secondly, smokers do harm to the health of those around them. Passive smoking is as dangerous as smoking a cigarette.</p><p>Additionally, nicotine is a drug that causes addiction like heroin or cocaine.</p><p>However, some people do not give up smoking for various reasons. Some&#160;of them believe that smoking helps them relieve stress. If&#160;they are worried about something, smoking a cigarette can instantly calm them down. Others smoke to look cool, because of peer pressure or because they do not want to appear different.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that numerous health hazards posed by nicotine far outweigh few advantages of smoking. Those who ignore the fact that smoking has extremely negative effects on health and appearance, should be prepared to face such problems as wrinkles, tooth decay, smoker&#8217;s cough, heart problems, lung cancer and many others.</p><p>To conclude, smoking has negative effects on almost every aspect of one&#8217;s life. If&#160;people want to live longer and to look better, they should stop smoking. Moreover, since it is extremely difficult to quit the habit, it is better not to&#160;start.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a130">Some people believe that the problems caused by gambling are very serious</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Various forms of gambling, including the lottery, horseracing and online gambling are extremely popular today. Some&#160;people enjoy risking their money and possessions once in a while, but others may become compulsive gamblers and lose everything they have. The&#160;question is whether gambling is harmless fun or a real problem.</p><p>In my opinion, the distress caused by compulsive gambling can be very considerable. Firstly, compulsive gambling threatens a person&#8217;s financial well-being. People often gamble away large sums of money and even money meant for bills and other household&#160;items.</p><p>Secondly, gambling has a devastating effect on the addict&#8217;s family. Gamblers often ignore their spousal and parental duties, which may lead to quarrels and divorce. Additionally, gambling addiction can cause work-related problems. Regular absence from work and the inability to do one's job can result in dismissal.</p><p>However, some people say that gambling allows them to satisfy their desire for adventure. It&#160;helps them relax and escape from the problems of everyday life. Besides, many people say that just the thought of winnings makes them feel excited.</p><p>Anyway, by trying to win back money that they have lost, gamblers often lose more. To&#160;complicate matters further, they may borrow money from friends and relatives. Some&#160;gambling addicts resort to stealing when their savings are depleted.</p><p>To conclude, gamblers cannot think of anything but their addiction. Compulsive gambling can result in debts, family breakdown and loss of interest in other activities. That&#160;is why it is vitally important to try to overcome this addiction before it is too&#160;late.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a131">Some people say that capital punishment should be allowed</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The death penalty has always been a highly controversial topic. Many&#160;countries have outlawed it, while some still practice capital punishment. However, is it morally acceptable to sentence people to&#160;death?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;am against capital punishment. Firstly, I&#160;think that nobody deserves it, no matter what the crime. Secondly, errors might be made, and innocent people might be killed. What&#160;is more, I&#160;believe that the death of the criminal does not make up for the crime they have committed.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that capital punishment prevents crime. Those who are for the death penalty believe that killing a person who has committed a capital crime deters other would-be criminals. Besides, some people think that the death penalty is better than life imprisonment because taxpayers will not have to pay for the room and legal costs of people who have been charged with a capital offence.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that capital punishment is not a deterrent to crime. To&#160;my mind, most people who commit offences that carry the death penalty do not think rationally about the consequences of their actions. Moreover, killing the murderer will not bring the victim&#160;back.</p><p>To conclude, society is dehumanized by the death penalty because it puts stress on the need for vengeance. It&#160;is not clear if capital punishment deters crime; that is why I&#160;feel that it must be abolished or used only in extreme cases. I&#160;am convinced that life imprisonment</p><p>can be more effective than capital punishment.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a132">Some people believe that the lives of the disabled are much easier nowadays</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>In the past, many societies were cruel to disabled people, and sometimes they were left to fend for themselves or even locked away in mental asylums. These days, there are few misconceptions about people with disabilities. However, does this mean that handicapped people are happier&#160;today?</p><p>In my opinion, nowadays, disabled people have more opportunities than they did some years ago. Firstly, they have a chance to recover or regain some functions due to advances in medical technology. Secondly, the Internet enables disabled people to work from home and to communicate with others. In&#160;addition, there are special devices and equipment that make disabled people more independent, including wheel chairs, motorized scooters and vehicles with hand controls.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that the disabled still have some serious problems. Firstly, they face discrimination from employers who may choose healthier employees. Another problem is that disabled people often have difficulty in getting around. They&#160;cannot use public transportation or enter buildings that do not have wheelchair ramps. As&#160;a result, people with disabilities remain homebound and feel depressed.</p><p>Anyway, today many companies are not allowed to refuse a person a job because he or she has only one leg, or cannot speak. Moreover, there are a lot of events for disabled people such as the Paralympics that help to raise their self-esteem.</p><p>To conclude, living with disability requires dealing with plenty of problems.</p><p>Nonetheless, modern technology has done a lot to allow the disabled to live their lives to the full. They&#160;are happier because they can work, play sports, travel, date, and make friends.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a134">Some people say that there is nothing better than watching TV</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>People spend more and more time watching TV. There is one or even more than one TV set in every house; televisions can be seen in shops and cafes, before treadmills at the gym and in airport terminals. However, is it all right to spend so much time in front of the television every&#160;day?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that television has numerous benefits. Firstly, it informs viewers of the latest international and local events. Secondly, television provides entertainment for millions of people and gives them a chance to &#8216;travel&#8217; all over the world. Viewers can be entertained for hours with news and sports programmes, reality shows, TV games and feature films. Moreover, television helps us enrich our experience, introduces us to new ideas and activities, spreads cultural values and gives us food for thought.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that television has some serious drawbacks. Most&#160;viewers are concerned about TV violence, which contributes to aggressive behaviour and makes people fear the world around them. In&#160;addition, television makes people idle. The&#160;more time they watch TV, the less time they have for physical activity and social interaction. Television distracts us from our family and everyday chores.</p><p>Anyway, nobody can force you to spend hours staring at the TV screen or to watch violent films and programmes. Besides, I&#160;believe that watching TV can bring families and friends together, stimulate conversations and provoke discussion.</p><p>To conclude, it is difficult to imagine life without television. It&#160;broadens our horizons by bringing worldwide events and faraway places into our homes. I&#160;believe that television can be very educational and entertaining as long as we watch the right programmes.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a135">Some people believe that watching TV can have harmful effects on children</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, children cannot imagine their lives without television. Watching TV may seem like a harmless activity, but it can have bad effects on children&#8217;s health and behaviour. The&#160;question arises whether kids should be allowed to watch&#160;TV.</p><p>In my opinion, TV viewing is not the best activity for kids. Firstly, modern children get a heavy dose of TV violence. They&#160;may either develop immunity towards cruelty or acquire aggressive behaviour. Secondly, watching TV interferes with many activities such as doing homework, reading, playing sports and spending time with friends and family. Another problem is that commercials encourage children to spend much money on clothes, fast food, electronic devices and entertainment.</p><p>However, some people say that television is not without its advantages. Firstly, it can be a useful supplement to classroom education. Educational TV programmes improve children&#8217;s vocabulary, increase their knowledge of history and science and expose them to classical music and art, to the diversity of the animal kingdom and the wonders of outer space. In&#160;addition, some parents use television as a babysitter when they need to do housework.</p><p>Anyway, studies have shown that children who spend much time in front of the television do poorly on tests at school and have small vocabularies. Besides, when parents are busy, kids watch whatever they choose.</p><p>To conclude, watching TV can be bad for children. It&#160;can result in risky behaviour, poor grades, lack of communication, depression, and obesity. That&#160;is why parents must pay attention to the programmes their children watch and limit the amount of time kids spend in front of the screen.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a136">Some people think that reality TV shows are enjoyable and bring many benefits to the audience and the actors</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The popularity of reality TV shows continues to grow. Some&#160;viewers think that they are very entertaining, while others do not find these shows amusing. The&#160;question is whether</p><p>watching reality shows is just a waste of&#160;time.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that both participants and viewers have to deal with reality TV disadvantages. Firstly, participants do not have any privacy, and they cannot control what ends up on TV. Secondly, some reality shows encourage poor behaviour. Many&#160;viewers believe that what they are watching is indeed &#8216;reality&#8217;, and they begin to act in the same way as those on the shows. Thirdly, reality shows often teach young people that humiliation is quite acceptable and that it is a necessary step towards success.</p><p>However, some people say that reality shows can have some benefits. Firstly, they can teach viewers that hard work and self-confidence help to overcome all difficulties.</p><p>Additionally, reality shows allow participants to display and develop their talents or to win large sums of&#160;money.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;do not think that reality shows change participants&#8217; lives for the better. On&#160;the contrary, actors are often put in embarrassing situations, which can damage their reputation. Participants&#8217; behaviour that appears on TV may ruin their careers and damage their relationships with family and friends. Besides, although some reality shows are inspirational, most of them are silly and shocking.</p><p>To conclude, reality shows encourage viewers to derive entertainment from the suffering and humiliation of other people. They&#160;have no educational value and do not give us food for thought. In&#160;my opinion, when it comes to reality shows, the negatives outweigh the positives.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a137">Many people watch soap operas because they find them enjoyable and realistic</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Millions of viewers enjoy watching soap operas. They&#160;cannot tear themselves away from the screen when their favourite serial is on. However, are soap operas really worth the viewer&#8217;s attention?</p><p>In my opinion, watching soap operas is a waste of time. Firstly, the relationships of characters are hopelessly complicated, and plot twists are highly improbable. Secondly, soap operas are too predictable. Characters fall in love with the wrong person, discover that their lives are in danger, fight with their faithless spouses, commit felonies, or inherit a fortune from their distant relatives. Moreover, one can easily become addicted to soap operas. Many&#160;people look forward to the next episode and spend an enormous amount of their free time watching TV series.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people find soap operas highly entertaining. Soap&#160;operas are different from the real world. They&#160;allow viewers to escape into melodrama and fantasy which they provide. Besides, some people say that soap operas have taught them how to save a relationship from breaking or to fix their problems.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;think it would be better if viewers tried to make their lives more interesting instead of spending hours in front of the TV and watching actors fall in love, quarrel or separate. They&#160;could go out, meet new people or take up a useful&#160;hobby.</p><p>To conclude, those who are fond of soap operas often ignore their families and do not participate in social activities to feed their addiction. Viewers can enjoy a soap opera every now and then, but they should not forget about more useful activities. Besides staring at the TV screen, there are a lot of interesting things to&#160;do.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a138">Some people say that print media will disappear in the future</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Print media have declined in popularity. With&#160;television, radio and the Internet there is less of a need for newspapers and magazines. However, does this mean that they will be replaced with electronic or Internet&#160;media?</p><p>In my opinion, print media still have some advantages over other forms of media. Firstly, while a news broadcast usually gives a brief summary of accounts, newspaper articles include details, comments and opinions from experts. Secondly, when we watch TV or listen to the radio, it is the broadcaster who chooses the news and commercials.</p><p>Newspapers and magazines enable readers to choose the articles and advertisements they want to read. Additionally, newspapers and magazines are available 24&#160;hours a day and&#160;you</p><p>can read them whenever and wherever you&#160;want.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that print media have a number of disadvantages.</p><p>Firstly, they cannot capture sound and movement. Secondly, since printed media involve production, some time passes before information reaches the reader. That&#160;is why newspapers often contain day- old or even week-old&#160;news.</p><p>Anyway, unlike online media, magazines and newspapers are considered credible sources of information. Besides, magazines and newspapers are tangible. Readers can turn the pages of a magazine, underline some sentences and examine pictures.</p><p>To conclude, many people still choose print media because they cannot or do not want to work with current technology. Newspapers and magazines allow readers to learn the latest news, to look at images, to read advertisements and to do crossword puzzles. I&#160;think that print media will not disappear despite the advancement in technology.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a139">Some people say that radio is not as popular as it used to be</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Before the advent of cable television, DVDs and the Internet, radio was the dominant form of entertainment at home. Since the advent of technologies like the iPod, which can store a very large amount of music, radio has declined in popularity. Does&#160;this mean that radio will disappear?</p><p>In my opinion, radio has some advantages over other forms of media. Firstly, radio is the cheapest form of electronic entertainment. Secondly, as radio uses only sound, it lets us perform other activities at the same time such as driving or working. In&#160;addition, radio can amuse a large crowd, while other activities such as reading a magazine or surfing the Net usually provide entertainment for only one person.</p><p>However, some people still believe that radio has no future. The&#160;main disadvantage of radio is that it cannot transmit images, video or text, which makes it less entertaining than visual media forms. Besides, radio cannot receive information. Unlike the Internet, radio does not allow you to contact other people or to download&#160;songs.</p><p>Nevertheless, graphically oriented media can be a distraction. For&#160;example, using the Internet, watching TV or reading a newspaper are prohibited when you operate a vehicle. Anyway, nobody forbids you to listen to the radio in the car. A&#160;long drive is less tiring when it is accompanied by enjoyable&#160;music.</p><p>To conclude, though radio faces big challenges today, it remains popular with the public. Judging by the Internet and satellite radio boom, radio is not likely to disappear. I&#160;think that people will listen to the radio at home, at work and in the car for years to&#160;come.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a141">Some people say that shopping is interesting and enjoyable</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Different people have different attitudes towards shopping. Some&#160;love shopping no matter what they buy, while others do not like to go shopping at all. Therefore, the question arises whether shopping is a pastime or an everyday&#160;chore.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that shopping has plenty of disadvantages. Firstly, most shops are overcrowded, particularly at weekends. There is always noise and bustle there, and you have to stand in a queue for the cash desk. Secondly, a lot of hypermarkets are situated in suburban locations that are accessible only by car. Additionally, sales and special offers often encourage us to buy things that we do not need. Those who do not have much money to spend always have to remind themselves that they need to keep within a tight budget.</p><p>However, some people say that shopping is a stress-relieving activity. They&#160;find it rather enjoyable and admit that making purchases gives them a buzz. Besides, shopping has become more convenient. Many&#160;shops are open round the clock. Large supermarkets allow customers to buy a lot of goods under one roof and offer extra services such as cafes, pharmacies, banks or children centres.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;state again that those who love shopping too much often buy things on impulse. It&#160;is almost impossible to go to a shopping mall and leave with only what you intended to purchase.</p><p>To conclude, we should learn to say &#8216;no&#8217; when we go shopping. Those who love shopping should remember that besides making purchases, there are many interesting things to do. To&#160;my mind, the disadvantages of shopping can be greater than the actual enjoyment.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a142">Some people say that shopping malls have advantages over small shops</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Every city has at least one shopping mall. Many&#160;people like such shops and spend an enormous amount of their free time there. However, why do some people still prefer small shops to shopping&#160;malls?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that shopping malls have multiple advantages. Firstly, the shopping mall allows us to buy everything we need in one place. Secondly, the shopping mall provides shoppers with a wide choice of entertainment, including movie theatres, cafes, game machines, beauty salons and water parks. Thirdly, shopping malls are built for convenience and comfort. They&#160;are clean and aesthetically appealing, with covered car parks, a lot of benches, fountains and flowers.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people still prefer to buy everything they need in small shops. They&#160;say that the main disadvantage of the shopping mall is that crowds and long queues make shopping very difficult. Moreover, you can spend more money than you planned at the shopping mall because you always find something you like or want to buy&#160;there.</p><p>Anyway, if you do not go shopping at weekends and on holidays, you will save much time. Besides, if you make a shopping list and try to follow it, you are not likely to overspend.</p><p>To conclude, the shopping mall is a place where people can purchase goods, meet their friends and have a good time. You&#160;can buy everything you need, have a meal, go to the movies, play games, get a haircut or just have a cup of coffee with a friend there. I&#160;think that people go to the shopping mall because it helps them forget about their problems and escape the monotony of their everyday&#160;lives.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a143">Some people say that our lives would be better if we bought fewer goods</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Buying goods and services is considered to be very important in modern society. It&#160;seems that we purchase more things than we need. However, is it a good idea to reduce our purchases?</p><p>In my opinion, we need to buy fewer goods if we want to make our lives better. Firstly, by buying and consuming goods, we make air, water and soil dangerously dirty. Some</p><p>products have too much packaging, which creates more rubbish and causes pollution. Secondly, if we buy fewer goods, we will save natural resources. In&#160;addition, we will be able to save a lot of money. Consequently, there will be no need to work so much and we will be able to spend more time with family and friends, take up a new hobby, play sports and cook healthy&#160;food.</p><p>Nevertheless, many people shop to excess because they want to keep up with the latest fashion trends. Others make purchases out of loneliness or to battle depression. Besides, with all the sales and special offers they often buy more goods than they planned.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;do not think that shopping can make us happier. Buying things will not help us solve our problems. On&#160;the contrary, those who cannot control their urge to shop run out of money and feel guilty about spending so&#160;much.</p><p>To sum up, the production of various goods takes energy and resources. We&#160;damage our environment by polluting and overusing natural resources. As&#160;responsible individuals, we should think about what we really need to buy in order to reduce pollution and live longer and healthier&#160;lives.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a144">Some people say that online shopping is an excellent alternative to traditional shopping</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Web users can buy almost anything online these days. Although online shopping is easy, it comes with some potential dangers. Therefore, the question arises whether it is better to make purchases online or to go to a retail&#160;store.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that online shopping has many benefits. Firstly, Internet users can make purchases from home or workplace, which allows them to save much time and effort. Secondly, online stores are available 24&#160;hours a day. What&#160;is more, due to online shopping customers can buy from stores all over the&#160;world.</p><p>However, a lot of people still prefer conventional stores. They&#160;say that the main disadvantage of online shopping is that goods are not available for direct inspection, and you have to rely on photographs and product descriptions. Besides, consumers are worried about computer security Sometimes hackers steal names, addresses and credit card numbers.</p><p>Anyway, shoppers can find cheaper deals and a wider choice of products online than in regular shopping centres. They&#160;can compare prices and read customer reviews. Besides, if you use only legit shopping websites, you are likely to avoid problems connected with privacy and security.</p><p>To sum up, online shops enable users to make purchases without being rushed and at any time of the day. The&#160;main advantages of online shopping are its convenience, a broad selection of various goods and competitive pricing. To&#160;my mind, online shopping is much easier than conventional shopping: you have to select the goods that you need and place your order, and they will be delivered to your doorstep.</p> </div>

It&#160;is widely believed that recycling can solve the problem of waste disposal. However, are there any disadvantages to reusing&#160;waste?</p><p>In my opinion, recycling has a lot of economic and environmental benefits. Firstly, recycling keeps landfills from filling up with garbage. Secondly, it helps to save energy and conserve natural resources such as water, minerals and wood. What&#160;is more, by recycling, we can create new products, prevent harmful chemicals from contaminating our soil and water and reduce greenhouse emissions.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that recycling does have a few drawbacks. Firstly, it takes much time and effort to separate aluminium, steel and other metals from other recyclable materials like plastic and paper. Secondly, it is much more costly to recycle waste than just to throw it into a landfill. Besides, recycled materials are more expensive than materials that have not yet been recycled.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that recycling is worth all the time and effort. It&#160;helps to save energy, which in turn saves money. I&#160;believe that reducing pollution and creating a healthier environment must be our number one priority.</p><p>To conclude, if we want to live longer and healthier lives, it is vital to recycle waste materials. Recycling keeps us from depleting natural resources and helps to preserve our planet for future generations. I&#160;am convinced that recycling will help people solve many energy and environmental problems.</p> </div>

We&#160;begin to understand the importance of becoming environmentally friendly. However, is it really a good idea to change your lifestyle?</p><p>In my opinion, moving to a more &#8216;green&#8217; style of living has numerous advantages.</p><p>Firstly, going green is meant to preserve the environment, to cut harmful emissions, to save energy and natural resources and to reduce waste. Secondly, going green saves money. For&#160;example, recycling unwanted materials reduces production costs while conserving energy.</p><p>Moreover, those who adhere to more environmentally friendly practices feel happier because they know that they make &#8216;green&#8217; decisions every&#160;day.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that going green has some disadvantages. Firstly, it means a lot of work. You&#160;have to separate your waste and buy energy efficient appliances and environmentally friendly products. Besides, not everyone can afford to buy organic food, to get solar panels on their houses or to purchase a hybrid vehicle.</p><p>Anyway, this does not mean that going green is only for the wealthy. It&#160;does not take much time, money and effort to use less washing up liquids, to turn out the lights when you leave a room, to use fewer disposable goods or to reduce your personal pollution.</p><p>To conclude, we must try to decrease the impact our presence has on the environment.</p><p>Reducing pollution, maintaining a clean environment, saving money and improving our health are a few of the major benefits of going green. I&#160;believe that our lives will change for the better if more people switch to a green lifestyle.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a148">Some people prefer hybrid cars to traditional cars</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Today, people realize that making eco-friendly decisions can help the environment. Therefore, more and more drivers are turning to hybrid cars. However, some people still doubt if buying hybrids is really worth&#160;it.</p><p>In my opinion, hybrid cars have numerous benefits. Firstly, with a hybrid car drivers can save money on fuel costs. Hybrids are fuel-efficient because they use both battery power and gasoline when travelling. Secondly, since hybrid vehicles use less fuel, they emit less carbon monoxide, which is believed to contribute to global warming and climate change.</p><p>Additionally, hybrid cars run much quieter than conventional cars. When&#160;you stop at traffic lights, the petrol engine shuts down, so hybrids are completely silent.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that hybrid cars do have some drawbacks. First of all, they are priced significantly higher than even the most expensive fuel-powered cars. What&#160;is more, hybrid cars have a little less power than conventional&#160;cars.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that is not really a problem when driving round town. Besides, most hybrids can reach highway speeds just like conventional cars. What&#160;is more, hybrid cars need only occasional repair and maintenance, so they can save you money in the long&#160;run.</p><p>To sum up, hybrids enable drivers to reduce their impact on the environment without sacrificing their freedom and personal mobility. Hybrid cars reduce harmful emissions, decrease petroleum usage and reduce noise pollution. I&#160;believe that hybrids will replace fuel- powered cars in the future because they possess multiple environmental benefits.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a149">Some people think that there are many reasons to promote carpooling</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, many people prefer travelling together in one car to driving alone. That&#160;is because almost everyone understands the importance of becoming more environmentally friendly. However, is it really a good idea to carpool?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that carpooling has a lot of benefits. First and foremost, it helps the environment by reducing emissions. Secondly, if you do not use your car every day of the week, you can save money on car maintenance. Passengers can also share fuel, toll and parking costs. What&#160;is more, carpooling helps to reduce stress. Passengers can use the commute time to relax. For&#160;example, they can read a book or take a nap before arriving at the destination.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that carpooling has some disadvantages. The&#160;major drawback of carpooling is lack of flexibility. Passengers are dependent on other people. They&#160;have to leave work at the fixed hour and cannot drive to a supermarket on the way home to buy their groceries. Besides, some people prefer to drive themselves to reduce travel&#160;time.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that car sharing helps drivers to save much time. When&#160;people carpool, there are fewer cars on the road, which helps to reduce traffic. Therefore, drivers and passengers are likely to arrive at the workplace on&#160;time.</p><p>To sum up, carpooling has environmental, financial and health benefits. Those who choose to carpool can save much time, money and energy, as well as reduce the damage to the environment. That&#160;is why I&#160;think drivers should leave their vehicles at home and share&#160;cars.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a151">Some people say that modern teenagers are carefree</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>When we hear the word &#8216;teenager&#8217;, we often imagine a fun-loving young person who spends time having parties and socializing with peers. Some&#160;adults think that young people do nothing but have fun. However, is a teenager&#8217;s life as easy as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that teenagers face a variety of problems. Peer&#160;pressure is one of the biggest stressors for many young people. Some&#160;teenagers suffer from bullying, which can have a detrimental effect on their health, academic performance and self-esteem. Secondly, a lot of teenagers have serious body image issues. Both&#160;boys and girls may become critical of their looks and feel insecure. In&#160;addition, teenagers experience stress over schoolwork. They&#160;are often under pressure from their parents and teachers to perform well academically.</p><p>On the contrary, some people think that teenagers have few problems until they reach adulthood. Firstly, they do not have to work, and therefore they can dedicate all their time and energy to their studies and interests. Apart from that, young people seldom worry about their future and live in the present.</p><p>Anyway, some teenagers take part-time jobs and have to balance work and school. It&#160;is difficult for them to find time for their friends, interests and extracurricular activities.</p><p>Besides, many teenagers do think about their future and worry about getting into college and choosing a career that is best for&#160;them.</p><p>To conclude, the teenage years can be a very difficult life period. Coping with problems and deciding what to do with their lives can be stressful for young people. I&#160;think that adults should never label teenagers as light-minded or frivolous because that is a misconception.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a152">Some people are worried about the strong influence of peer groups on teenagers</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Young people attach much importance to relationships with their peers. Teenagers have a strong feeling that they must do the same things as other people of their&#160;age.</p><p>Therefore, the question arises whether the peer group is a good or bad influence on teenagers.</p><p>In my opinion, peers can have a positive influence on each other. Firstly, your friends can offer you a great deal of support and emotional nurturing and help you during a time of need or crisis. Secondly, young people never feel bored when they are surrounded by peers who share similar experiences and interests. Furthermore, peer groups teach teenagers to build relationships, to accept the differences in others and to interact with the opposite&#160;sex.</p><p>However, some people believe that the stresses in a teenager&#8217;s life can come from their peers. Peers may pressure young people into doing something that may have serious consequences. Another problem that teenagers may face is rejection. Those who are expelled from the group experience feelings of isolation, resentment, anger, anxiety and even depression.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that teenagers gain valuable experience while they interact with their peers. For&#160;example, learning to say &#8216;no&#8217; to their friends and to some of the activities they take part in is one of the most difficult lessons that teenagers need to&#160;learn.</p><p>To sum up, young people need to fit in with their peers and to win their acceptance and approval. Your&#160;peers can support you, help you make decisions and teach you to stand your ground. To&#160;my mind, teenagers should be allowed to decide who their friends are and what groups they spend time&#160;with.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a153">Parents have many concerns about their teenagers dating</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>As children grow, they find themselves attracted to the opposite sex and start dating.</p><p>Dating can be an exciting experience for teenagers, but it can also cause them numerous problems. Then&#160;the question arises: should parents give their children the freedom to&#160;date?</p><p>In my opinion, teenage dating has a lot of negatives. Firstly, the breakup of a relationship may result in emotional suffering and cause stress. The&#160;other problem with teenage dating is the risk of unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease. Teenagers</p><p>who become pregnant are more likely to drop out of school or start taking drugs. Additionally, most parents want to protect their kids from getting hurt and place many restrictions on young people. This&#160;adds stress to the parent-child relationship and motivates teenagers to&#160;rebel.</p><p>However, some people think that dating has some benefits for young people. Firstly, teenagers develop an understanding of the opposite sex and learn to socialize with their peers. Moreover, dating is great fun. Teenagers go to cafes, amusement parks or clubs while they are on a date and interact with different people.</p><p>Anyway, the world of teenage dating is filled with numerous problems. Young people may deal with jealousy, have arguments or even suffer from abuse. Most&#160;teenagers start dating before they are mature enough to build a healthy relationship.</p><p>To conclude, bad experiences may leave mental scars that will take time to heal. The&#160;risks of teenage dating include STDs, pregnancy, health problems, disappointment and depression. That&#160;is why teenagers should think twice before getting serious in a relationship, as they may end up getting disappointed or&#160;hurt.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a154">Some parents think that teenagers should not be given much independence</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The teenage years can become a real challenge for both parents and their children.</p><p>Most adults feel confused when their kids say that they need more privacy and independence. Many&#160;parents ask themselves whether they should continue to make rules or give teenagers more freedom.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that teenagers need independence. Firstly, giving teenagers independence means teaching them responsibility, which is essential for making healthy life choices. It&#160;is extremely important for young people to learn how to make their own decisions in life, without having to ask other people for permission or help. Secondly, teenagers need independence to acquire some basic life skills like cooking, shopping or baby-sitting. Thirdly, giving teenagers independence can boost their self-esteem.</p><p>However, some people are convinced that if they give their children too much independence, it could be abused. Parents worry that their children will have fun or exhibit risky behaviour. Besides, some adults think that teenagers are too young and immature to make their own decisions. Parents want to keep teenagers safe and prevent them from making mistakes by limiting their freedom.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that teenagers need to make decisions for themselves, since they are not babies any more. If&#160;their parents do not give them any independence, young people will not have an opportunity to gain valuable experience.</p><p>To conclude, teenagers need to take steps towards adulthood. By&#160;trusting young people and allowing them to make choices, parents help teenagers become responsible and mature individuals. I&#160;think parents should encourage their children to solve their own problems, to make decisions, to do things for themselves and to face challenges.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a156">Some people believe that animals should not be taken from their natural surroundings and put into zoos</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Spending a day at the zoo can be interesting and educational. However, some people do not like zoos because they think that animals are not happy there. The&#160;question arises whether it is ethical to keep wild animals in&#160;zoos.</p><p>In my opinion, keeping animals in zoos is cruel. Firstly, they are confined to a small area and feel bored and depressed. Secondly, in some zoos animals have to live in dirty and unhealthy conditions. Moreover, no matter how nice the zoo is, the enclosure does not compare with the natural habitat. Animals are much happier when they live in the wild because some of them are used to running, climbing, preying and roaming large territories.</p><p>On the contrary, some people may have a different point of view. They&#160;think that zoos provide a safe place for animals to live and encourage the reproduction of endangered species. What&#160;is more, zoo animals have access to medical care and good nutrition.</p><p>Anyway, although zoos claim to protect threatened species from extinction, most zoo animals are not endangered at all. Zoos&#160;prefer to keep exotic animals that attract large crowds of visitors. Besides, very few endangered species are successfully bred in captivity, and it is much more expensive to maintain animals in zoos than to protect them in the&#160;wild.</p><p>To sum up, zoos are like prisons for animals. Wild&#160;animals never get used to a life in captivity where they lack privacy and physical exercise. Although zoos give us a chance to see rare and wild animals without travelling to distant locations around the world, we should remember that living creatures might be extremely unhappy in their&#160;cells.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a157">Some people think that keeping exotic animals as pets is an interesting experience</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Some people love housing rare or difficult to keep animals. Most&#160;of them buy exotic creatures without thinking about the possible consequences. However, is it safe to keep wild or unusual animals as&#160;pets?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think there are some good reasons why people should not buy exotic animals. Firstly, it is almost impossible to domesticate some animals. Exotic pets remain dangerous and unpredictable, and they can seriously injure their owners. Secondly, taking care of an exotic pet is hard work. You&#160;will have to feed the animal, clean up after it and provide medical attention. Besides, it is expensive to keep an exotic pet. Some&#160;exotic animals need exotic food, special vitamins or accessories.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that taking care of an exotic creature will be fun. They&#160;believe that they will be noticed if they have exotic pets. Others just love animals and think that they will be able to take good care of&#160;them.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that buying an exotic pet may be a poor decision. Confinement makes some animals anxious and aggressive. As&#160;a result, your family and friends may fear your pet and refuse to come to your house. Moreover, some exotic pet owners discover that they cannot meet the needs of an exotic animal and want to get rid of&#160;it.</p><p>To conclude, sometimes those who buy exotic animals do not understand what they are getting themselves into. An&#160;exotic pet is a great responsibility. To&#160;my mind, exotic animals do not make good pets because they require special care and dedication, and they can pose a danger to their owners&#8217; health and safety.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a158">Some people think that keeping pets is a waste of time and money</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Many people keep cats, dogs, birds, fish, hamsters and other animals as pets. It&#160;is well known that having a pet requires time and care. Is&#160;it a good idea to get a&#160;pet?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that there are plenty of benefits of having a pet. Firstly, a lot of animals are loyal, affectionate and intelligent and love their owners no matter how people treat them. Your&#160;pet can lift your mood when you feel sad and comfort you when you are lonely or unhappy. Secondly, there are many health benefits of having pets. For&#160;example, dog</p><p>owners usually spend much time walking, running and playing games, which improves their fitness levels and has a positive impact on their health. Moreover, caring for pets teaches people to be responsible and sympathetic. Besides your love and attention, your pet needs clean water, nutritious food, warm shelter, medical care, and training.</p><p>However, some people think differently. They&#160;say that some animals are very expensive to keep. You&#160;need to buy them food and supplies and pay for vet care, medication or surgery. Additionally, some people are not content with pet hair, unpleasant smells, noise, muddy footprints or the occasional mess to clean&#160;up.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;believe that most pet owners do not care about the expenses, as they love their pets and cannot imagine life without them. Besides, those who have pets learn to be tidy and not to leave their things everywhere.</p><p>To conclude, having a pet is not all fun and games. It&#160;is also a big responsibility.</p><p>Nevertheless, those who have pets are usually happier and live longer than those who do&#160;not.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a159">Some people object to animal testing</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>The use of animals in scientific tests receives much criticism from animal rights activists. Some&#160;people say that animal testing has helped medicine to advance more quickly and safely than it otherwise would have, while others oppose scientific testing on animals. The&#160;question arises whether animal experimentation is a worthwhile practice or unjustified cruelty.</p><p>Personally, I&#160;am against animal testing. Firstly, thousands of animals are killed and injured during animal research. They&#160;suffer pain and have to live in captivity. Secondly, the medicine and products that have been tested on animals may never become approved for humans. Besides, unlike humans, animals cannot agree or refuse to be experimented&#160;on.</p><p>However, some people believe that the use of animals in scientific tests can have some benefits. First of all, animal testing often saves other animals and humans. It&#160;has led to the advancement of many modern life-saving drugs. Moreover, without animal testing, scientists would have to estimate the effects on humans, which would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that testing products and drugs on animals is not as effective as it seems to be. The&#160;use of animals in scientific tests provides inaccurate information about the effects of various drugs on the human body because animals and humans are not biologically identical. The&#160;same medicine can be safe for animals yet toxic to humans, and vice&#160;versa.</p><p>To sum up, animal testing does have disadvantages. Besides being cruel, many experiments are useless when applied to humans. That&#160;is why I&#160;think that scientists need to look for a better alternative to animal experimentation.</p> </div>

Cyber pets are now taking the place of live animals. However, is caring for a virtual pet interesting and rewarding?</p><p>In my opinion, virtual pets cannot compare with live animals. First of all, kids cannot touch or stroke their virtual pets. Digital pets cannot accompany children on walks and do not greet them when they come home after school. Secondly, virtual pets are usually predictable. Some&#160;of them never die and never grow up. Additionally, children may become preoccupied with their cyber pets and forget about their homework and household chores.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that virtual pets have several advantages over real pets. Firstly, it costs nothing to keep cyber pets, and they do not leave a mess to clean up. Secondly, virtual pets can replace real pets when a person has a very busy schedule, cannot afford the live animal or suffers from allergies.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that virtual pets cannot give children that same bond they would get with a real pet. Although cyber pets are relatively cheap and easy to train and play with, there is no substitute for the love, loyalty and companionship of a real&#160;pet.</p><p>To sum up, taking care of live animals teaches children responsibility because a real pet needs water, food, training, grooming and attention. Only&#160;real pets can keep us company,</p><p>reduce feelings of stress, and improve our health. I&#160;think that a virtual pet cannot replace the live animal, but it can help prepare the child for a real&#160;pet.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a162">Some people think there are a lot of benefits of living in a big city</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Every year millions of people stream into big cities. It&#160;is well known that a big city offers many amenities and modern facilities. However, is urban life as wonderful as it seems to&#160;be?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that city residents face plenty of problems. Firstly, pollution levels are dangerously high in big cities. Air&#160;pollution affects people&#8217;s health and causes diseases such as asthma. Secondly, crime rates in cities are higher than in rural areas. Additionally, city residents have to face stressful situations every day. Doing things in a rush, noise, crowds, traffic jams, long commutes and the invasion of their personal space may turn their lives into complete&#160;chaos.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people like the speed and convenience of urban life. First of all, a city provides a wide choice of entertainment. City&#160;residents can visit clubs, restaurants, cafes, discos, theatres, museums, art galleries, cinemas, and parks. Besides, people have more chances to receive a good education and to build a successful career in a big&#160;city.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that life in the countryside is quieter, healthier and safer. Only&#160;there you can breathe clean air and enjoy silence and the beauties of nature.</p><p>To conclude, a lot of people enjoy living in a big city with a well-developed infrastructure, a competitive job market and a wide variety of social activities and events. Nonetheless, today, many city dwellers choose to leave crowded cities and return to a slower pace of life. In&#160;the countryside, people are friendly and calm because their lives are much less stressful than the lives of city residents.</p> </div>

Some&#160;people think that it is not necessary for them to learn foreign languages, while others have a different point of view. Therefore, the question arises whether learning other languages is a worthwhile undertaking.</p><p>In my opinion, the benefits of learning foreign languages are numerous. Firstly, learning foreign languages can make you an attractive candidate for many jobs and improve your chances of career development. Secondly, learning foreign languages is important for those who are fond of travelling. If&#160;you are able to communicate with the locals, read signs and understand your surroundings, travelling will be much easier. What&#160;is more, those who learn foreign languages display better problem solving skills and have more flexible minds and sharper memories.</p><p>However, some people think that there are some disadvantages of learning foreign languages. First of all, it requires a significant investment of your time and effort. You&#160;could do something else with your time, such as read books, exercise or take up a new&#160;hobby.</p><p>Additionally, not everyone can afford to take college courses or pay for private tutoring.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;do not agree with the above-mentioned opinion. Many&#160;people find pleasure and enjoyment in learning a new language. Besides, it is possible to learn foreign languages from self-study.</p><p>To conclude, learning foreign languages improves your thinking abilities and expands your horizons. Foreign language learners are introduced to other cultures, which results in broader understanding of the world, of politics, history, and human interactions.

Most&#160;people believe that one can master the English language only in England. However, is it possible to learn English in one&#8217;s own country?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that if you want to have no difficulty with English, you should go to England. First of all, you will have chances to listen to native speakers, and you will have a lot of speaking practice there. Secondly, the language learner needs to enter into long stretches of communication, in real and complex situations, which is possible only in the country where people have English as their mother tongue. Moreover, immersion in a foreign culture helps people learn more about the English language and broadens their horizons.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that it is not necessary to go to England in order to learn English. You&#160;can join language classes or hire a tutor who speaks the language fluently.</p><p>Besides, it is very expensive to live and to study in England, and many people do not have enough money to pay for their English courses or prefer to do something else with those resources.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that for the spoken language, people should be taught by native speakers. Those who want to speak English fluently need to be able to handle language which is not idealized&#160;&#8212; language in&#160;use.</p><p>To conclude, it is well known that the most effective way to learn a foreign language is to become immersed in it.

The&#160;lives of film stars, singers, professional athletes and fashion designers seem glamorous and exciting when we read about them in magazines and watch them on TV. However, are celebrities as happy as they seem to&#160;be?</p><p>In my opinion, there are numerous negative aspects of being famous. The&#160;main disadvantage of fame is invasion of privacy. Paparazzi will go to any lengths to find out every single detail of celebrities&#8217; private lives. Secondly, celebrity stalkers may turn violent and pose a real threat to well-known people. Obsessed fans can follow celebrities, send them threatening letters, steal their property, scare them to death or even kill them. Additionally, some celebrities cannot cope with the pressures, which results in drug and alcohol addiction, depression or suicide.</p><p>On the contrary, some people have a different point of view. They&#160;say that celebrities have tons of money and can afford to buy luxury homes, cars, and private jets. Well-known people dine at the best restaurants, visit exotic countries and stay in five-star hotels.</p><p>Another advantage of being famous is the adoration, love and attention of the public.</p><p>Anyway, not all famous people have money. Some&#160;celebrities spend too much, get into debt and end their lives with nothing. Besides, the public often expect celebrities to be absolutely perfect in every aspect of their lives; otherwise they will be strongly criticized.</p><p>To conclude, well-known people often have exciting careers, fabulous looks and extravagant lifestyles that most people would envy.

The&#160;question arises whether good time management skills can improve our&#160;lives.</p><p>To my mind, time management skills are essential for both professional and private life. Firstly, they help you use your time more effectively and accomplish goals more quickly. Secondly, as you practice effective time management techniques, you will find work less stressful because you will learn to set realistic goals, to prioritize your tasks and to do more activities in a shorter time-span. In&#160;addition, thanks to good time management skills, you will have more time for yourself. You&#160;can take breaks at your workplace and spend more time with your family and friends.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that it is hard to acquire time management skills.</p><p>Others believe that with time-management skills you can do more work, but you may end&#160;up</p><p>having to redo it because of its poor quality.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that if you improve your time management skills, you will become more organized and productive. By&#160;practicing time management techniques daily, you automatically become better at performing your&#160;tasks.</p><p>To sum up, poor time management can result in lost promotions, failed job interviews, constant fatigue and stress. With&#160;good time management skills you will be able to keep a balance between work and relaxation, and you will find greater fulfilment and satisfaction in your work. I&#160;think that developing time management skills is essential to increasing your productivity both at work and at&#160;home.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a167">Some people do not care whether they buy pirated or legal CDs and DVDs</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, piracy is a highly profitable business. People can find pirated CDs and DVDs for sale just about anywhere. The&#160;question arises whether pirated disks are identical to legal copies.</p><p>In my opinion, we should not buy pirated copies. First of all, they are made illegally. Therefore, buying pirated CDs or DVDs does not provide any money to the original authors of works. Another problem with pirated DVDs is their poor picture and sound quality. The&#160;worst are those filmed in a movie theatre because shadows and audience noises are also recorded. Pirated music CDs may sound like they have been recorded from the radio. What&#160;is more, those who unknowingly buy a pirated DVD&#160;may be charged with a&#160;crime.</p><p>However, some people still choose to buy pirated disks for various reasons. Firstly, genuine disks are usually rather expensive, and not everyone can afford to buy&#160;them.</p><p>Secondly, those who buy pirated DVDs can watch movies currently being shown at cinemas.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that purchasing pirated disks is a false economy. Besides, sometimes people do not know what they are actually buying and pay for a pirated CD&#160;or DVD&#160;as much as they would pay for a genuine&#160;copy.</p><p>To conclude, piracy has a bad effect on a country's economy, consumers and legal producers. Film&#160;studios, actors and movie theatres all lose money, while consumers have to buy goods of poor quality. That&#160;is why governments must impose tougher penalties for piracy, and people should be careful what they&#160;buy.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a168">Some people think it is important to be honest in any situation</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Being honest means being sincere and trustworthy. It&#160;is widely believed that honesty is the foundation for an individual&#8217;s success and happiness. However, is honesty always the best policy?</p><p>Personally, I&#160;think that people should try to be honest all the time. First of all, dishonesty can destroy relationships. If&#160;your friends and relatives are not truthful with you, it may result in distrust and quarrels. Secondly, honesty is important for a person&#8217;s professional success. Honest people have good working relationships with their superiors and colleagues and win the trust of their clients. Moreover, a dishonest person may be caught in a lie, which can damage his or her reputation and cause stress.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people think that sometimes it is difficult to be honest without being harsh. If&#160;what you are about to say may hurt another person, it might be best to keep your opinions to yourself or to tell a white lie. Additionally, many people tell a lie to protect their personal interests or to hide a secret.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that although telling the truth may upset other people, it is better to be honest. Telling one lie can lead to another and then another&#160;&#8212; it is a vicious circle. Besides, some lies may seem harmless to one person, but others may think differently.</p><p>To conclude, there are a lot of reasons why people lie, but most of them are selfish. Though sometimes it is difficult to tell the truth, it is usually the right thing in the end. I&#160;believe that honesty is essential for a positive self-image that can help you achieve anything you decide to&#160;do.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a169">Some people say that ambitiousness is the key to success and happiness</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>These days, ambitiousness is a much-valued character treat. Some&#160;people believe that all go- getters are happy and satisfied with their lives, while others think that ambitiousness cannot lead to success or bring contentment. Then&#160;the question arises whether we really need to be ambitious in order to get to the&#160;top.</p><p>In my opinion, it is extremely important to be ambitious nowadays. First of all, people have to be ambitious if they want to get anywhere in the business world. Besides being hard-working, a person must be determined to become successful, rich and powerful.</p><p>Secondly, ambitious people believe in themselves, know how to obtain their goals and keep trying despite a failure, which is essential for both professional and private life. Moreover, ambitious people are prepared to take on new challenges. Every time they reach a goal, they add another in its&#160;place.</p><p>However, some people think that an ambitious person cannot be happy. Firstly, such an individual sees the world as a battle. Rivalry is his or her principal emotion. Ambitious people are socially detached, they are on their own. Secondly, an ambitious individual is convinced that the rewards of ambition&#160;&#8212; wealth, success, power&#160;&#8212; are worthy of the sacrifices made on its behalf.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;still believe that ambitious people are more successful than others in all aspects of life. There is nothing wrong with being competitive, but they should make sure they do not go too far to achieve their&#160;goals.</p><p>To conclude, ambitious people are flexible, strong-willed and determined to succeed.</p><p>Without ambition, people would never get anywhere. I&#160;believe that ambition is the first step in success for everyone.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a170">Some people think that we should use critical thinking rather than trust intuition</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Both intuition and critical thinking skills are essential in real-world situations. Many&#160;people are afraid of relying on their powers of intuition when making decisions. However, should intuition be discarded as something worthless?</p><p>I believe that the guiding role of intuition should not be underestimated. Firstly, sometimes intuition enables an individual to foresee events before they happen. Secondly, intuition is valuable for communication. A&#160;highly intuitive person tends to have a &#8216;sense&#8217; about people and to apply high intuition skills to sizing up situations and new acquaintances. Moreover, when it is impossible to employ critical thinking skills or there is something wrong with the situation, you should listen to your inner&#160;voice.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people believe that analysis and rationality are superior to intuition. For&#160;instance, intuition may not be helpful in determining another&#8217;s personality. The&#160;situation may not give the observer an opportunity to see the traits that would indicate the personality. Besides, a person who uses skills of intuition may form an opinion on the basis of &#8216;gut instincts&#8217; and is likely to rapidly reach conclusions without analysing the situation.</p><p>Anyway, I&#160;state again that intuition helps us modify our behaviour and make right decisions in uncertain situations and unknown areas. Sometimes even doctors base a diagnosis on intuition as much as on scientific&#160;tests.</p><p>To conclude, much of what we do is often based largely on intuition. Though people do not fully understand how intuition works, we cannot deny its existence. I&#160;think people should try to develop their intuitive powers and learn to trust their intuition.</p> </div>
								<div class="holder-btn-expand-hidden-layer"><h2 class="btn-expand-hidden-layer" id="a171">Some people say that nonverbal messages improve communication</h2></div><div class="holder-hidden-layer"><p>Nonverbal communication often helps us understand other people&#8217;s feelings. Some&#160;people say that nonverbal messages are more important than verbal communication.</p><p>However, can gestures, touch, posture, tone of voice and facial expressions tell us much more about others than what they are saying?</p><p>In my opinion, the effectiveness of communication depends largely on nonverbal signals. Firstly, understanding nonverbal messages helps us interpret the moods and actions of other people. Nonverbal signals can indicate whether a person is lying, feeling angry or experiencing stress. Secondly, by using gestures and facial expressions, you can communicate private information, which is often brief and to the point. Additionally, nonverbal communication makes verbal communication more emotional and helps us hold the attention of our listeners.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people say that nonverbal signals may prevent effective communication. Firstly, nonverbal messages may contradict what is being said. For&#160;example, someone is saying that he is calm and relaxed, but his tense expression shows that he is nervous or uneasy. Another disadvantage of nonverbal communication is its ambiguity. Unlike words, nonverbal messages can be unclear and confusing. As&#160;a result, another person may misinterpret your nonverbal signals.</p><p>Anyway, if you are aware of the nonverbal messages you are sending, you will be able to make a good impression. You&#160;are at an advantage if you can control your body language. To&#160;conclude, nonverbal messages can speak louder than words. They&#160;can help to calm,</p><p>encourage and inspire the people around you. I&#160;think that interpreting nonverbal communication is crucial to understanding other people.</p></div>
