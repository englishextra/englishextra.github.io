I&#160;have this fantasy&#8230; if I&#160;ever won a&#160;Golden Globe or ahh&#8230; an Academy&#160;Award I&#8217;d use the opportunity to tell&#160;the Yanks how to make a&#160;decent cup of&#160;tea.</p><p>&#8212; Well here&#8217;s to a&#160;good cup of&#160;tea.</p><p>&#8212; Cheers.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;love your ahh&#8230; I&#160;love your&#160;coat.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.

We&#160;just love it&#160;here.</p><p>&#8212; That&#8217;s a&#160;long&#160;time. I&#160;do love visiting L. A. But I&#160;always say, it&#8217;s a&#160;great place&#160;to visit, it&#8217;s an even nicer place to&#160;leave. The palm trees&#8230; Palm trees annoy the fuck out of&#160;me.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, well it&#8217;s not for everybody. I&#160;like it here, but we came out&#160;here for the work and&#160;stuff.

Comedy&#8217;s such a&#160;difficult&#160;thing.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah. Well your career seems to&#160;be going terribly&#160;well. I&#160;mean, you&#8217;ve got a&#160;lot of&#160;heat at the moment.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; Is that why you&#8217;re&#160;here?</p><p>&#8212; Well you know&#8230; The merry-go-round of meetings.</p><p>&#8212; It&#8217;s nice, people are &quot;finally&quot;&#8230; starting to take a&#160;bit of notice. Which is&#160;great.</p><p>&#8212; Are you meeting on anything interesting?</p><p>&#8212; Yeah&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; I&#8217;ve got to say you were just&#8230; fantastic in 24&#160;Hour&#8230; No, seriously, 24&#160;Hour Party People was just a&#160;knock-out. I&#160;mean, brilliant. Great&#160;work.</p><p>&#8212; Thank&#160;you.</p><p>&#8212; Really brilliant. I&#160;was&#8230; And the reviews. They were pretty fuckin&#8217; great. I&#160;was amazed&#8230; because you know it was&#8230; I&#160;didn&#8217;t think many people would&#160;get all the sort of, cultural references. Sort of, Manchester, early 80&#8217;s the whole kind of music scene&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; You&#8217;d be surprised.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, but a&#160;lot of people really didn&#8217;t have any kind of reference to make to&#160;it. Because of the&#8230; They know about the bands over&#160;here. But the whole thing, your character and his running the TV show&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Do you want a&#160;cigarette? Sorry, they&#8217;re French.</p><p>&#8212; Oh, that&#8217;s okay. Thanks.</p><p>&#8212; No. I&#8217;ll save it for&#160;later.</p><p>&#8212; Oh, okay&#8230; umm so, Laura said&#8230; she said, that you were really&#160;keen to meeting. Something she didn&#8217;t tell&#160;me.</p><p>&#8212; She wouldn&#8217;t tell me what it&#160;was. Well I&#160;didn&#8217;t want to say it over the&#160;phone because it would&#8217;ve sounded&#160;weird. I&#160;can imagine how she thought this was coming out of nowhere. I&#160;phone her up, doesn&#8217;t know me from&#160;Adam. I&#160;must talk to Steve Coogan. But I&#160;wanted to see you in person. When I&#160;found out you were going&#160;to be here for a&#160;couple of days&#8230; I thought this&#160;was the perfect opportunity&#8230; Anyway&#8230; I&#8217;ll get right to&#160;it. I&#8217;m so excited about&#160;this. Let me try and put&#160;it in context. I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;ve always&#160;had a&#160;big passion for history. You know&#8230; and people&#8217;s lives&#8230; and all the little events&#160;of how you get from A to&#160;B. And all the small details&#160;in people&#8217;s lives, are kind of really&#8230; full of epic qualities. You&#160;know? So I&#8217;ve been doing all this research. Anyway, I&#8230; I&#8217;ve come up with&#160;this.</p><p>&#8212; And what state is&#8230; is it greenlit or is&#160;it just a&#160;treatment? What&#160;stage is it&#160;in?</p><p>&#8212; I&#8217;m sorry no. God, how embarrassing&#8230; It&#8217;s not some&#8230; This isn&#8217;t work, has nothing to do with&#160;work. It&#8217;s not you know, a&#160;project. What this&#160;is&#8230; is I&#160;did some genealogical research&#8230; and what I&#160;came across&#8230; What I&#160;discovered was&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Mister Coogan?</p><p>&#8212; Yes?</p><p>&#8212; It is you, isn&#8217;t&#160;it?</p><p>&#8212; It is, yes.</p><p>&#8212; Oh umm&#8230; I&#8217;m such a&#160;huge&#160;fan.</p><p>&#8212; You&#8217;re not that&#160;huge. Only where it counts.</p><p>&#8212; Could I&#160;bother you for an autograph.</p><p>&#8212; Absolutely. Great. I&#8217;ve been recognized. Where do you want&#160;it?</p><p>&#8212; Oh, umm paper is&#160;fine.</p><p>&#8212; Spoil-sport.</p><p>&#8212; Oh no, no. Don&#8217;t do&#160;that.</p><p>&#8212; Sorry.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;probably have something in my&#160;bag.</p><p>&#8212; Okay.</p><p>&#8212; Give me a&#160;second&#160;here.</p><p>&#8212; Oh gosh. So&#160;sorry.</p><p>&#8212; It&#8217;s alright.</p><p>&#8212; Give me one more minute.</p><p>&#8212; Take your&#160;time.</p><p>&#8212; Here, please, in&#160;there.</p><p>&#8212; Okay, and what&#8217;s your&#160;name?</p><p>&#8212; Katy. Katy. With a&#160;Y.</p><p>&#8212; Alright. What&#160;Katy did&#160;next.</p><p>&#8212; Hello.</p><p>&#8212; Alfred&#8217;s an actor&#160;too.</p><p>&#8212; Here.</p><p>&#8212; Oh. Thank you. Great. Thank you very&#160;much.</p><p>&#8212; You&#8217;re welcome. Never&#160;mind.</p><p>&#8212; Wow&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Well, let&#8217;s get back to&#160;this. I&#160;don&#8217;t want to take&#160;up too much of your&#160;time. I&#160;know you&#8217;re busy&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Sure. Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; As I&#160;said, I&#160;did this genealogical research. I&#160;was just doing&#160;it for my own interest&#8230; I&#160;wasn&#8217;t looking for anything specific. I&#160;just came across&#160;this. I&#8217;ll cut a&#160;long story&#160;short. Steve Coogan&#8230; Drum roll. Umm</p><p>&#8212; well the thing is&#160;Steve.</p><p>&#8212; You and I&#160;are cousins.</p><p>&#8212; How do you&#160;mean? What&#8230; Do you mean artistically?</p><p>&#8212; No. No. No!</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;mean in the normal&#160;way. We&#8217;re cousins. We&#8217;re related.</p><p>&#8212; Whoa.</p><p>&#8212; It&#8217;s amazing isn&#8217;t?</p><p>&#8212; Yeah. I&#160;mean&#8230; Are you&#160;sure?</p><p>&#8212; See the way it works out is, look&#8230; My great-great grandfather&#160;is your great-great&#160;uncle. And further back, we shared the&#160;same great-great-great grandfather.</p><p>&#8212; Wow, yeah&#8230; my ancestry is&#160;Irish, but I&#160;knew there was an Italian&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Well that&#8217;s&#160;it! The Italian connection&#160;is our great-great-great&#160;great grandfather, Giuseppe. Wow. Isn&#8217;t that amazing?</p><p>&#8212; This is a&#160;lot of detail.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, well it&#8217;s my&#160;thing. I&#160;kinda do a&#160;little&#8230; Amazing. I&#160;think it&#8217;s just great to say&#160;that I&#8217;m related to Steve Coogan.</p><p>&#8212; Likewise, I&#160;can tell people I&#8217;m related to Albert Molina.</p><p>&#8212; Alfred.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah&#8230; No it&#8217;s my Grandmother&#8230; who&#8217;s the big one on the family&#160;tree. She&#8217;ll be very thrilled. She&#8217;s a&#160;huge fan of your&#160;work.</p><p>&#8212; She loved you in&#8230; Boogie Nights.</p><p>&#8212; Oh right! With&#160;the shorts&#160;and the shotgun? Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, she talked about that&#160;once.</p><p>&#8212; Great. Great. But&#160;you know&#8230; I&#160;know this is coming right out of the&#160;blue. But just think of the possibilities. It&#8217;s fantastic, listen, let&#8217;s look at the&#160;facts. We&#8217;re both actors. We&#8217;re cousins, we&#8217;ve established&#160;that. We could&#8230; We could maybe work together. Do a&#160;play&#160;maybe. We could make a&#8230; a&#160;movie. We could actually do a&#160;movie about this&#160;story. About discovering this amazing&#160;thing between us. That&#160;we&#8217;re cousins. The story could be two actors who discover that they&#8217;re cousins. We could actually play ourselves. We&#8217;d be in the movie, I&#8217;d be Fred Molina you&#8217;d be Steve Coo&#8230; We&#8217;d be cousins. In the movie. It&#8217;s fantastic! It&#8217;d be great. Absolutely&#160;great! You know&#8230; or not. I&#160;mean, you&#160;know&#8230; we could just hang&#160;out. Yeah, no, we should definitely&#160;go for a&#160;beer sometime. That&#8217;d&#160;great. Maybe go on vacation together you&#160;know. Just the two of&#160;us sort of, get to know each&#160;other.</p><p>&#8212; You&#8217;re not gay are&#160;you?</p><p>&#8212; No. No. No, no. I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m married.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, well, so was James the&#160;First. Sorry. I&#160;don&#8217;t&#160;know that popped into my&#160;head. Say it, get it out of the&#160;way. Know what I&#160;mean?</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;understand.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;know exactly what you&#8217;re thinking. If somebody came up to me&#160;going I&#8217;m your cousin&#8230; I&#8217;d think they were a&#160;nutter as&#160;well. Take it from me, I&#8217;m not&#160;crazy. I&#160;just think this is a&#160;fantastic, extraordinary, delightful thing for&#160;me.</p><p>&#8212; Absolutely.</p><p>&#8212; And I&#160;just wanted you to know about&#160;it.</p><p>&#8212; Ditto.</p><p>&#8212; All I&#160;want, if I&#160;want anything&#160;is for you to&#160;just acknowledge this extraordinary&#160;thing. And&#8230; and just love&#160;me.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah. I&#160;could do&#160;that. I&#160;have to&#8230; go. I&#160;didn&#8217;t tell you&#8230; I have this meeting. It actually moved forward.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;see.</p><p>&#8212; It&#8217;s at Universal. Number crunchers, financiers. So umm&#8230; This&#8230; This&#8230; Is this ahh&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; That&#8217;s for&#160;you.</p><p>&#8212; Okay.</p><p>&#8212; It&#8217;s&#160;yours.</p><p>&#8212; I&#8217;ll make sure that gets&#160;filed.</p><p>&#8212; Sure. Sure. Well you&#8217;re going to be&#160;here for a&#160;couple of days, right? So maybe we could see each&#160;other before you&#160;go.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, ahh&#8230; Okay&#8230; ummm&#8230; checking the mental diary&#8230; This is not&#8230; This is not&#160;good. The time I&#8217;m&#160;here. It&#8217;s just backed&#160;up.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;understand. Listen, no problem. Give me your cell-phone number&#160;and I&#8217;ll call you before you&#160;go.</p><p>&#8212; There&#8217;s a&#160;story there&#8230; The&#8230; The&#8230; The&#8230; There&#8217;s a&#160;tri-band system&#160;here in the states. Which is different to&#8230; the system in the&#160;UK. And it&#8217;s a&#160;kind of&#8230; We&#8230; The cell-phones&#8230; they don&#8217;t work&#160;here. So I&#8217;m kind of cell-phone less, in the U. S.</p><p>&#8212; Oh I&#160;see. Well&#8230; give&#160;me your home number, I&#8217;ll call&#160;you.</p><p>&#8212; You&#8217;ve got my PA&#8217;s number, right?</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; Great, then we&#8217;re connected.</p><p>&#8212; Well, can&#8217;t&#8230; can&#8217;t you give&#160;me your number at&#160;home?</p><p>&#8212; Can I&#160;say&#160;no? Because nothing, absolutely no&#8230; nothing personal, it&#8217;s just I&#160;don&#8217;t&#8230; I&#160;never give my number out. Ever. It&#8217;s just a&#160;space&#8230; personal space&#160;thing. I&#160;never&#8230; It&#8217;s just a&#160;rule&#8230; and I&#160;always think, stick to the&#160;rule, stick to the rule&#8230; You know, stick to the rule. And&#8230; it&#8217;s more of a&#160;philosophy than a&#160;rule, really. I&#160;can say&#8230; I&#8217;ve not given my number out to many&#8230; eminent people in the&#160;past. I&#160;once didn&#8217;t give my number&#160;to Sam Mendes. So&#160;you&#8217;re in good company.</p><p>&#8212; Well if it&#8217;s good enough&#160;for Sam Mendes, it&#8217;s good enough for&#160;me.</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;think it&#8217;s&#160;me.</p><p>&#8212; Oh that&#8217;s right. Mine&#160;doesn&#8217;t&#160;work.</p><p>&#8212; I&#8217;m sorry, I&#160;got to take this&#8230; Hello?</p><p>&#8212; Yeah. Yeah, sure.</p><p>&#8212; Spike, hi&#8230; How you&#160;doing? Yeah, you got the message. My agent just called you, just&#160;to make sure we&#8217;re all on the same&#160;page. No the producer credit is just&#160;so you and I&#8230; Can sort of keep tabs on everything you know, artistic integrity all that sort of&#160;thing. Otherwise the whole&#160;thing could just run&#160;away. Oh you bastard, no&#8230; Alright. Yeah, you still okay for Sunday? Good, alright. Will I&#160;meet you there? Alright. Nice and early. Okay&#160;yeah, yeah. Lots of&#160;love. Bye, bye&#160;Spike. I&#8217;m sorry about&#160;that.</p><p>&#8212; It&#8217;s okay, okay&#8230; Fine. Fine. So&#8230; Umm&#8230; You&#8230; Was&#8230; Was that Spike&#160;Lee?</p><p>&#8212; Oh no, no, no. I&#160;don&#8217;t even know Spike&#160;Lee. No, that was Spike&#160;Jonze.</p><p>&#8212; Spike&#160;Jonze!</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; I&#160;love&#160;him!</p><p>&#8212; Yeah, he&#8217;s a&#160;good man. Good&#160;man, Spike. Yeah, we&#8217;ve been&#8230; We&#8217;ve&#160;been friends for a&#160;long, long time&#160;now. We&#8217;re both keen hikers, We&#8217;ve&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s very boring.</p><p>&#8212; No, no, no, go&#160;on.</p><p>&#8212; Well we belong to a&#160;club. And we go hiking on weekends. He&#8217;s a&#160;very, very, very committed environmentalist.</p><p>&#8212; Spike Jonze is a&#160;tree-hugger&#8230; Jesus, I&#160;never had him down as&#160;that.</p><p>&#8212; Well, I&#160;think he prefers the&#160;term leaf-people. As do&#160;I.</p><p>&#8212; Right, yeah, no&#8230; I&#160;mean, that&#8217;s&#8230; Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I think it&#8217;s great, I&#160;love&#160;trees. I&#160;think there should be&#8230; there should be more of&#160;them. When I&#160;use paper, I&#160;use both&#160;sides. Umm&#8230; I&#160;would love to&#8230; You know, I&#8217;m going to tear&#160;up that stupid rule&#160;about phone numbers and&#8230; It&#8217;s such&#160;shit. Would it be shabby of&#160;me to give you my number&#160;now?</p><p>&#8212; Yeah.</p><p>&#8212; Okay. Okay. Okay.</p><p>&#8212; I&#8217;ve&#8230; I&#8217;ve got to go. I&#8217;m so&#160;sorry.</p><p>&#8212; I&#8217;ll get the&#160;check.</p><p>&#8212; Good.</p><p>&#8212; Fuck&#8230;</p></div>

Налить тебе&#160;чаю?</p><p>&#8212; Спасибо, я&#160;сам&#160;налью.</p><p>&#8212; Вот молоко.</p><p>&#8212; Настоящий&#160;чай!</p><p>&#8212; Да.</p><p>&#8212; Не так-то просто&#160;найти. У меня есть мечта&#8230;, если я&#160;когда-нибудь получу Золотой Глобус или&#8230; Оскар я&#160;воспользуюсь возможностью рассказать янки, как приготовить пристойный&#160;чай.</p><p>&#8212; Так выпьем за&#160;хорошую чашку&#160;чая.</p><p>&#8212; Выпьем.</p><p>&#8212; Мне нравится&#8230; мне нравится твой пиджак.</p><p>&#8212; Да, это Вив Вествуд. Я&#160;просто&#8230; Мне нрав&#8230; Я&#160;испытываю слабость к&#160;британским дизайнерам. Да. Я&#160;ничего не&#160;знаю об&#160;американских дизайнерах. Просто они слишком&#8230; осторожные.</p><p>&#8212; Тебе не&#160;жарковато? На улице под 30&#160;градусов.</p><p>&#8212; Да. Нет, я&#160;снимаю его, когда выхожу.</p><p>&#8212; А&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Просто здесь кондиционер.</p><p>&#8212; Понятно.</p><p>&#8212; И как давно ты&#160;живешь в&#160;Лос-Анджелесе?</p><p>&#8212; О, мы&#160;здесь уже около семи&#160;лет.</p><p>&#8212; Вау.</p><p>&#8212; Нам нравится&#160;здесь.</p><p>&#8212; Большой срок. Мне&#160;нравится приезжать в&#160;Лос-Анджелес. Но я&#160;всегда говорю: &#171;Сюда хорошо приезжать, но&#160;еще лучше уезжать&#187;. Эти пальмы&#8230; Пальмы меня просто выводят из&#160;себя.</p><p>&#8212; Да, это не&#160;для&#160;всех. Мне здесь нравится, но мы&#160;приехали&#160;сюда&#8230; я&#160;приехал сюда работать и&#160;все такое. Это здорово&#8230; Здорово что мы, наконец, встретились. Должен сказать я&#160;большой фанат твоих&#160;работ. Всего, что ты&#160;сделал на&#160;ТВ всех этих комедий&#8230; У меня есть все&#8230; у&#160;меня есть все записи. Знаешь, я&#160;заказываю&#160;их. Это фантастика.</p><p>&#8212; Спасибо.</p><p>&#8212; Да, я&#8230; Знаешь, я&#160;тоже&#8230; я, конечно очень хорошо о&#160;тебе осведомлен.</p><p>&#8212; Здорово.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;видел тот твой сериал.</p><p>&#8212; О да, ты&#160;его&#160;видел?</p><p>&#8212; Да.</p><p>&#8212; Вау.</p><p>&#8212; Интересно.</p><p>&#8212; Его закрыли.</p><p>&#8212; Да, я&#160;слышал. Комедия&#160;&#8212; такая сложная&#160;штука.</p><p>&#8212; Да. А твоя карьера, похоже идет исключительно хорошо. Я&#160;хочу сказать к&#160;тебе сейчас большой интерес.</p><p>&#8212; Да.</p><p>&#8212; Да.</p><p>&#8212; Ты поэтому&#160;здесь?</p><p>&#8212; Ну, знаешь&#8230; Просто карусель встреч. Это хорошо, люди, наконец-то&#8230; стали повнимательнее. И это здорово.</p><p>&#8212; А есть какие-то интересные проекты?</p><p>&#8212; Да&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Должен сказать ты&#160;был просто фантастичен в &#171;Тусовщиках&#187;&#8230; Нет, серьезно, &#171;Круглосуточные тусовщики&#187;&#160;&#8212; это сногсшибательно. Просто блестяще. Прекрасная работа.</p><p>&#8212; Спасибо.</p><p>&#8212; Настоящий шедевр. Это было&#8230; А отзывы критиков&#8230; Они были охренительны. Я&#160;был поражен&#8230; потому что, знаешь&#8230; Я&#160;не&#160;думал, что многие поймут все эти, в&#160;общем, аллюзии. Как, например, Манчестер, начало 80-х, вся эта музыкальная&#160;сцена.</p><p>&#8212; Ты не&#160;представляешь.</p><p>&#8212; Да, но&#160;многие действительно не&#160;понимают всех этих отсылок. Потому что&#8230; Они знают о&#160;местных группах. Но все это, твой&#160;герой как он&#160;ведет телешоу&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Хочешь сигарету? Извини, они французские.</p><p>&#8212; Ничего страшного, спасибо. Нет, я&#160;оставлю на&#160;потом.</p><p>&#8212; А, хорошо.</p><p>&#8212; Итак, Лора сказала&#8230; Она сказала, что тебе прямо не&#160;терпелось встретиться. Но&#160;кое-что он не&#160;сказала. Она не&#160;сказала, зачем.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;не&#160;хотел говорить об&#160;этом&#160;по телефону, это прозвучало&#160;бы странно. Могу представить, что она подумала. Вдруг, ни с&#160;того, ни с&#160;сего&#8230; Я&#160;звоню ей, она меня в&#160;глаза не&#160;видела. &#171;Я хочу поговорить со&#160;Стивом Куганом&#187;. Но я&#160;хотел увидеться с&#160;тобой&#160;лично. Когда я&#160;узнал, что ты&#160;приезжаешь сюда на&#160;пару&#160;дней я&#160;подумал, что&#160;это прекрасная возможность&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Ну на&#160;какой стадии&#8230; Его уже запустили или это предварительная версия? На каком он&#160;этапе?</p><p>&#8212; Извини, ладно, ближе к&#160;делу. Я&#160;так взволнован. Я&#160;попытаюсь объяснить все в&#160;контексте&#8230; Я&#160;всегда страстно увлекался историей. Понимаешь&#8230; судьбы людей&#8230; все этим маленькие события, которые переносят тебя из&#160;пункта А в&#160;пункт&#160;Б. И, и&#160;все эти&#8230; Боже, мне так стыдно. Это не&#8230; Это не&#160;работа, это не&#160;имеет отношения к&#160;работе. Понимаешь, это не&#160;проект. Дело в&#160;том, что я&#160;провел генеалогическое исследование и&#160;пришел к&#160;тому, что&#8230; Я&#160;обнаружил, что&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Мистер&#160;Куган?</p><p>&#8212; Да?</p><p>&#8212; Это ведь&#160;вы?</p><p>&#8212; Да, я.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;ваша большая поклонница.</p><p>&#8212; Ну, не&#160;такая уж и&#160;большая. Только там, где&#160;нужно.</p><p>&#8212; Могу я&#160;попросить вас об&#160;автографе?</p><p>&#8212; Ну конечно. Здорово. Меня признали.</p><p>&#8212; Где вам его поставить?</p><p>&#8212; Думаю, на&#160;бумаге.</p><p>&#8212; Ну вот, все испортила.</p><p>&#8212; О, нет, нет, не&#160;здесь.</p><p>&#8212; Извини.</p><p>&#8212; У меня, наверное, есть в&#160;сумочке!</p><p>&#8212; Хорошо.</p><p>&#8212; Подождите секундочку&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; О&#160;Боже.</p><p>&#8212; Мне так&#160;жаль.</p><p>&#8212; Все в&#160;порядке.</p><p>&#8212; Еще минуточку.</p><p>&#8212; Не спешите.</p><p>&#8212; Вот, пожалуйста, здесь.</p><p>&#8212; Хорошо, и&#160;как вас&#160;зовут?</p><p>&#8212; Кэти. Кэти. Через &#171;Э&#187;.</p><p>&#8212; Хорошо.</p><p>&#8212; &#171;Что Кэти сделает завтра&#8230;&#187;</p><p>&#8212; Привет.</p><p>&#8212; Альфред тоже актер.</p><p>&#8212; Держите.</p><p>&#8212; О, спасибо. Замечательно.</p><p>&#8212; Огромное спасибо.</p><p>&#8212; Да не за&#160;что.</p><p>&#8212; Вот это да&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Давай вернемся к&#160;этому. Не хочу отнимать у&#160;тебя&#160;время. Я&#160;знаю, как ты&#160;занят&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Конечно. Да.</p><p>&#8212; Как я&#160;уже сказал, я&#160;провел генеалогическое исследование. Я&#160;делал это исключительно для&#160;себя не&#160;искал ничего конкретного. И случайно наткнулся вот на&#160;что. Скажу вкратце.</p><p>&#8212; Стив Куган&#8230; Барабанная&#160;дробь. Дело в&#160;том, Стив&#8230; что ты и я&#160;&#8212; кузены.</p><p>&#8212; В каком смысле? Что&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; То есть в&#160;художественном&#160;плане?</p><p>&#8212; Нет, нет, нет!</p><p>&#8212; В самом обычном смысле.</p><p>&#8212; Мы кузены. Родственники.</p><p>&#8212; Это изумительно, правда?</p><p>&#8212; Ага, да&#8230; В смысле&#8230; Ты уверен?</p><p>&#8212; Вот как это получилось, смотри. Мой прапрадед&#160;&#8212; твой двоюродный прапрадед. Более&#160;того у&#160;нас один и&#160;тот&#160;же пра-пра-прадед.</p><p>&#8212; Вот это да&#8230; Мои предки&#160;&#8212; ирландцы, но я&#160;знаю, что был итальянец&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Вот именно! Итальянская связь&#160;&#8212; наш пра-пра-пра-прадед, Джузеппе.</p><p>&#8212; Да уж&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Разве это не&#160;удивительно?</p><p>&#8212; Сколько деталей.</p><p>&#8212; Да, вот такое у&#160;меня&#160;хобби.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;как&#160;бы немного&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Невероятно.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;думаю, это просто здорово, сказать &#171;Я&#160;&#8212; родственник Стива Кугана&#187;.</p><p>&#8212; Аналогично, я&#160;могу говорить&#160;всем что я&#160;родственник Альберта Молины.</p><p>&#8212; Альфреда.</p><p>&#8212; Ну да&#8230; Нет, моя бабушка&#8230; она больше&#160;всех знает о&#160;нашей родословной. Она будет потрясена. Она&#160;&#8212; твоя большая поклонница. Она в&#160;восторге от&#160;тебя в&#8230; &#171;Ночи в&#160;стиле буги&#187;.</p><p>&#8212; Ах, да, в&#160;шортах и с&#160;дробовиком? Да, она как-то говорила об&#160;этом.</p><p>&#8212; Прекрасно, прекрасно&#8230; Я&#160;понимаю, для тебя это как гром среди ясного&#160;неба. Но только подумай&#160;об открывающихся возможностях. Это фантастика, слушай посмотрим на&#160;факты. Мы оба актеры мы&#160;кузены, мы&#160;установили&#160;это. Мы можем&#8230; Мы можем работать вместе возможно, играть. Мы могли&#160;бы сделать&#8230; фильм! Мы действительно&#160;можем сделать фильм об&#160;этой истории! О том, как мы&#160;открыли&#160;этот удивительный факт, что мы&#160;кузены. Это история о&#160;двух актерах, которые обнаруживают, что они кузены. Мы могли&#160;бы играть сами&#160;себя. Мы будем в&#160;фильме, я&#160;буду Фред Молина ты&#160;&#8212; Стив Ку&#8230; Мы будем кузенами. В фильме! Это&#160;фантастика! Потрясающе, просто потрясающе! Понимаешь&#8230; или нет&#8230; Знаешь мы&#160;могли&#160;бы просто тусоваться. Мы точно можем сходить как-нибудь выпить пива. Было&#160;бы здорово. Может, съездить вместе в&#160;отпуск понимаешь только ты и я&#8230; Ну, как&#160;бы узнать друг друга получше&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Ты случайно не&#160;гей?</p><p>&#8212; Нет. Нет. Нет, нет. Я&#8230; я&#160;женат.</p><p>&#8212; Ну, Яков Первый тоже был&#160;женат. Прости. Я&#160;не&#160;знаю, это&#160;вдруг пришло мне в&#160;голову. Я&#160;сказал это вслух, просто вырвалось. Понимаешь о&#160;чем&#160;я?</p><p>&#8212; Понимаю. Я&#160;прекрасно понимаю о&#160;чем ты&#160;думаешь. Если&#160;бы кто-то подошел ко&#160;мне и&#160;сказал: &#171;Я твой кузен&#187;&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;бы тоже подумал, что он&#160;псих. Поверь мне, я не&#160;сумасшедший. Я&#160;просто подумал, это&#160;же фантастическое, исключительное восхитительное событие для&#160;меня.</p><p>&#8212; Безусловно.</p><p>&#8212; И я&#160;просто хотел, чтобы ты&#160;знал об&#160;этом.</p><p>&#8212; Аналогично.</p><p>&#8212; Все что я&#160;хочу, если я&#160;вообще чего-нибудь&#160;хочу это чтобы ты&#160;признал&#160;этот потрясающий факт. И&#8230; и&#160;просто полюбил&#160;меня.</p><p>&#8212; Да, я&#160;могу это сделать.</p><p>&#8212; Мне пора&#8230; идти. Я&#160;не&#160;сказал тебе&#8230; у&#160;меня назначена встреча. Ее перенесли на&#160;более раннее&#160;время.</p><p>&#8212; Понятно.</p><p>&#8212; Это в &#171;Юниверсал&#187;. Бухгалтеры, финансисты&#8230; Что&#160;ж, э&#8230; Это&#8230; Это&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Это&#160;тебе.</p><p>&#8212; Хорошо.</p><p>&#8212; Это твое.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;позабочусь чтобы это занесли в&#160;архив.</p><p>&#8212; Конечно. Конечно.</p><p>&#8212; Ты&#160;же будешь здесь еще пару&#160;дней? Может, еще увидимся до&#160;твоего отъезда?</p><p>&#8212; Да&#8230; Хорошо&#8230; Проверяю внутренний ежедневник&#8230; Нет&#8230; Нет, не&#160;получится. Мое время&#8230; У меня все забито.</p><p>&#8212; Понимаю. Нет проблем. Дай мне своей мобильный и я&#160;позвоню до&#160;твоего отъезда.</p><p>&#8212; Тут такая история&#8230; Здесь, в&#160;Штатах трехдиапозонная система. Она отличается от&#8230; системы в&#160;Британии. Ну и&#160;как бы&#8230; Э&#8230; Мобильные&#8230; они не&#160;работают&#160;здесь. Так что я&#160;как&#160;бы без телефона, в&#160;США.</p><p>&#8212; А, понятно. Ладно&#8230; дай мне&#160;свой домашний номер. Я&#160;позвоню&#160;тебе.</p><p>&#8212; У тебя ведь есть номер моего секретаря?</p><p>&#8212; Да.</p><p>&#8212; Отлично, значит, мы на&#160;связи.</p><p>&#8212; Так ты&#160;можешь дать&#160;мне свой домашний&#160;номер?</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;могу сказать &#171;нет&#187;? Здесь нет ничего, абсолютно ничего&#8230; ничего личного, просто я не&#8230; не&#160;даю свой домашний номер. Никогда. Это вроде как&#8230; личное пространство. Я&#160;никогда&#8230; Это просто правило&#8230; а я&#160;всегда&#160;думаю &#171;Выполняй правила, выполняй правила&#187;&#8230; Понимаешь, &#171;Выполняй правила&#187;? Это скорее философия, чем правило. Могу только сказать&#8230; я не&#160;давал свой номер многим выдающимся&#160;людям. Однажды я не&#160;дал его Сэму Мендесу. Так что ты в&#160;хорошей компании.</p><p>&#8212; Ну, что годится для Сэма Мендеса подойдет и&#160;мне.</p><p>&#8212; Да&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Думаю, это&#160;мой.</p><p>&#8212; Да, мой&#160;же не&#160;работает.</p><p>&#8212; Прости, мне нужно ответить. Алло?</p><p>&#8212; Да. Да, конечно.</p><p>&#8212; Спайк! Привет&#8230; Как&#160;ты? Да, ты&#160;получил сообщение. Мой агент звонил тебе, чтобы убедиться что мы&#160;пришли к&#160;соглашению. Нет, продюсеры в&#160;заглавных титрах&#160;&#8212; именно так, ты и я&#8230; Так сказать, контролировать все ну, знаешь, художественная достоверность и&#160;тому подобное. В противном случае все может просто развалиться. Ах ты&#160;мерзавец, нет&#8230; Хорошо. В воскресенье все остается в&#160;силе? Хорошо, согласен. Мы там увидимся? Хорошо. Достаточно&#160;рано. Ни свет ни&#160;заря. Да, хорошо. Всего наилучшего. Пока, Спайк.</p><p>&#8212; Извини.</p><p>&#8212; Ничего, все в&#160;порядке. Так&#8230; Ну&#8230; Ты&#8230; Это&#8230; Это был Спайк&#160;Ли?</p><p>&#8212; О, нет, нет, нет. Я&#160;даже не&#160;знаком со&#160;Спайком&#160;Ли. Это был Спайк&#160;Джонз.</p><p>&#8212; Спайк&#160;Джонз?</p><p>&#8212; Да.</p><p>&#8212; Обожаю&#160;его.</p><p>&#8212; Да, он&#160;хороший парень. Хороший. Да, мы с&#160;ним&#8230; Мы с&#160;ним дружим уже очень, очень&#160;давно. Мы обожаем пешие походы, мы&#8230; Ладно, это очень скучно&#8230;</p><p>&#8212; Нет, нет, продолжай.</p><p>&#8212; Мы состоим в&#160;одном клубе&#160;и ходим в&#160;походы по&#160;выходным. Он очень, очень убежденный защитник окружающей&#160;среды.</p><p>&#8212; Спайк Джонз&#160;&#8212; древолюб? Господи, никогда и не&#160;подумал&#160;бы.</p><p>&#8212; Думаю, он&#160;предпочитает термин &#171;зеленый&#187;. Как и&#160;я.</p><p>&#8212; Прекрасно&#8230; В смысле&#8230; Не пойми меня превратно. Я&#160;думаю, это здорово. Я&#160;люблю деревья. Я&#160;считаю, что их&#160;должно&#8230;. Я&#160;считаю, их&#160;должно быть больше&#8230; Когда я&#160;пишу на&#160;бумаге, я&#160;использую обе стороны. Я&#160;бы хотел&#8230; Знаешь, я&#160;бы хотел отменить это дурацкое правило насчет номера телефона и&#8230; Это такое дерьмо. Будет&#160;ли это нормально, если я&#160;теперь дам тебе свой&#160;номер?</p><p>&#8212; Нет.</p><p>&#8212; Ладно. Хорошо. Хорошо.</p><p>&#8212; Мне&#8230; мне пора. Извини.</p><p>&#8212; Я&#160;заплачу.</p><p>&#8212; Хорошо.</p><p>&#8212; Блядь&#8230;</p></div>
