Specifications are detailed descriptions of the deliverables for a&#160;project and include all the technical, time and cost requirements of a&#160;project.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;This customer software doesn&#8217;t meet our original specifications.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Baseline</h3><p>The baseline will include the project&#8217;s expected costs, schedule and any technical requirements.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Our baseline expectation is to&#160;complete the project by December at a&#160;cost of no more than&#160;$4 million.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Resources</h3><p>All items needed to&#160;complete a&#160;project, such as a&#160;tool, supply item, facility or person. People (human resources) and money (financial resources) are often the most important elements of a&#160;project.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The scope of a&#160;project needs to&#160;watch the resources available to&#160;carry it out.&#8217;</span></p><h3>To estimate</h3><p>To calculate or guess the value, size or amount of something.</p><h3>An estimate</h3><p>The noun form can be either: an estimate or an estimation</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The value of the deal is estimated at&#160;$12 million.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Top-down estimate</h3><p>An estimate for the cost, time, and risks of a&#160;project made by looking at the entire project&#8230; from the top-down, or in great detail, and comparing it to&#160;similar projects in the&#160;past.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Richard has worked on several similar projects before, so he can give us a&#160;top-down estimate of how much this owe should cost.&#8217;</span></p><h3>To allocate</h3><p>To decide that аn amount of money, time or other resources should be used for a&#160;certain purpose. This&#160;verb often appears in two strong collocations: to&#160;allocate funds &amp; to&#160;allocate resources.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Du Pout has allocated funds to&#160;build two new factories in Asia.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Margin</h3><p>A spare amount of money, time or other resources that is set aside in case of unforeseen problems, costs or delays.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;This construction project has a&#160;two-week margin to&#160;allow for delays due to&#160;bad weather.&#8217;</span></p><p>The meaning of margin is similar to&#160;our next&#160;word&#8230;</p><h3>Contingency</h3><p>A planned allocation of resources that are to&#160;be used in the event that something unforeseen,&#8230; such as a&#160;bad weather, affects the completion of a&#160;project according to&#160;the schedule.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;We need to&#160;develop plans to&#160;deal with any contingencies before starting the project.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Change order</h3><p>A request for а&#160;change in a&#160;project&#8217;s scope, deliverables or cost. Most&#160;large projects will require change orders, either because the project manager sees the need for changes or because the client&#8217;s needs have changed.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;It&#8217;s important to&#160;get the client to&#160;approve any change orders before allocating more resources.&#8217;</span></p><h3>To sign off</h3><p>To give approval for someone else&#8217;s decision.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The finance director needs to&#160;sign off on any change in our approved vendors.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Practice</h3><p>Now, it&#8217;s your turn to&#160;practice. For&#160;example, if you&#160;hear&#8230;</p><p><span class="italic">The value of the deal is &lt;beep&gt; at &#163;12 million.</span></p><p>You can&#160;say&#8230;</p><p><span class="italic">The value of the deal is estimated at &#163;12 million.</span></p><h4>Question 1</h4><p><span class="italic">We need to&#160;&lt;beep&gt; more resources to&#160;meet the new deadline.</span></p><h4>Answer 1</h4><p><span class="italic">We need to&#160;allocate more resources to&#160;meet the new deadline.</span></p><h4>Question 2</h4><p><span class="italic">It&#8217;s important to&#160;consult with all the &lt;beep&gt; who may be affected by the relocation of our plant.</span></p><h4>Answer 2</h4><p><span class="italic">It&#8217;s important to&#160;consult with all the stakeholders who may be affected by the relocation of our plant.</span></p><h4>Question 3</h4><p><span class="italic">Since the &lt;beep&gt; of this project is quite broad, we&#8217;ll need to&#160;make our plans as detailed as possible.</span></p><h4>Answer 3</h4><p><span class="italic">Since the scope of this project is quite broad, we&#8217;ll need to&#160;make our plans as detailed as possible.</span></p><h4>Question 4</h4><p><span class="italic">The finance director needs to&#160;&lt;beep&gt; on any changes to&#160;our accounts.</span></p><h4>Answer 4</h4><p><span class="italic">The finance director needs to&#160;sign off on any changes to&#160;our accounts.</span></p><h4>Question 5</h4><p><span class="italic">Any project that doesn&#8217;t allow for &lt;beep&gt; is likely to&#160;run into problems.</span></p><h4>Answer 5</h4><p><span class="italic">Any project that doesn&#8217;t allow for contingencies is likely to&#160;run into problems.</span></p><h4>Question 6</h4><p><span class="italic">Unfortunately, the new software doesn&#8217;t meet the original &lt;beep&gt;.</span></p><h4>Answer 6</h4><p><span class="italic">Unfortunately, the new software doesn&#8217;t meet the original specifications.</span></p></div>

Similarly, think about corporate identity and brand identity, two factors that help your customers &#8220;see&#8221; you and your products.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s look at the vocabulary in more detail with some definitions and examples.</p><h3>Brand</h3><p>A brand is what sets a&#160;company&#8212;or its products and services&#8212;apart from its competition. This&#160;includes the way it&#8217;s presented to&#160;the public, customers&#8217; expectations and experiences with the brand, and the way it&#8217;s perceived by others.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;McDonald&#8217;s brand incorporates the concepts of fast food, fun, convenience, and variety.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Essence</h3><p>Often called a&#160;brand&#8217;s &#8220;heart and soul,&#8221; brand essence refers to&#160;the fundamental spirit of the brand&#8212;what connects a&#160;brand to&#160;customers&#8212;expressed in a&#160;simple, concise, phrase.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Hallmark produces greeting cards and gifts. its brand essence is &#8220;Caring Shared.&#8221;</span></p><h3>Brand Values</h3><p>Brand values are the aspects of a&#160;brand that bring value to&#160;the customer. This&#160;value is why the customer chooses the&#160;brand.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Driving a&#160;BMW can make someone feel successful and luxurious. These feelings are part of the brand&#8217;s value.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Demographics</h3><p>Demographics refers to&#160;information about customers, such as their age, education level, and where they live. Demographic is the adjective&#160;form.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;In October 2009, InsideFacebook.com reported demographic information about Facebook users. 29% of the users were between the ages of 18&#160;and 25.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Tangible</h3><p>Something is tangible if it has a&#160;physical form, something that can be perceived through one of the five senses. In&#160;marketing, tangible often refers to&#160;direct benefits customers can receive from a&#160;brand.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Starbucks customers who participate in its rewards program can receive tangible benefits like free coffee drinks and Wi-Fi access.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Intangible</h3><p>Something that is intangible does not have a&#160;physical form that can be perceived through the senses. Intangible benefits are more conceptual, like a&#160;certain feeling you get when buying a&#160;product or using a&#160;service.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The peace of mind that comes from driving a&#160;Volvo is one of the intangible benefits of the brand.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Focus Group</h3><p>A focus group is a&#160;small group of people that represents a&#160;target demographic. The&#160;group discusses products and services so that companies can learn more about what their customers&#8217; think about the brand or product.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The company used data from focus groups to&#160;decide the name of their new product.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Awareness</h3><p>When customers recognize a&#160;brand and connect it with a&#160;company&#8217;s products, they&#8217;re showing brand awareness.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Because it is new to&#160;the United States, the Chinese sportswear company Li-Ning is still developing brand awareness among Americans.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Recognition</h3><p>When customers show that they know about a&#160;brand when asked specifically about it, they&#8217;re showing brand recognition. Brand recognition is one way to&#160;measure brand awareness.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Toblerone&#8217;s unique packaging and strong promotion in duty-free shops add to&#160;its brand recognition.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Trademark / Logo</h3><p>A trademark or logo is a&#160;graphic symbol that represents the brand. Words, phrases and sounds can also be trademarks.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The &#8220;swoosh&#8221; is a&#160;trademark of Nike. Apple&#8217;s logo is an apple with a&#160;bite taken out of it.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Corporate Identity</h3><p>A company&#8217;s corporate identity is the way it presents itself visually to&#160;the public. These visual elements can include color schemes, logos, words, building architecture, interior design, uniforms, and printed materials.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;To show its corporate identity, Mobil Oil consistently displays the word &#8220;Mobil&#8221; in the same text and colors on all of its signs and uniforms.&#8217;</span></p></div>

Brand equity&#8212;its marketing strength&#8212;and differentiation&#8212;how it is different from competitors&#8212;need to&#160;be considered when developing a&#160;brand strategy, or long-term marketing&#160;plan.</p><p>As always, customers are a&#160;key ingredient. Who&#160;will receive your marketing message? That&#8217;s your market segment. How&#160;do customers view the brand? That&#160;question is answered by its positioning. Do&#160;customers repeatedly buy the brand? That&#8217;s all part of brand loyalty.</p><p>Once the brand is established, there are ways to&#160;take it further. Niche marketing can help you reach more specific groups of customers. Rebranding, co-branding, and brand stretching are all ways to&#160;adjust your brand in response to&#160;changing tastes and values. In&#160;the end, a&#160;successful brand will help your company become a&#160;market leader.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s look at these concepts in more detail with some definitions and examples.</p><h3>Brand Management</h3><p>Brand management means overseeing all aspects of a&#160;brand, such as advertising, price, and customer satisfaction so that the brand remains in a&#160;positive light, making it more profitable.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Building trust with consumers is the ultimate aim of brand management.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Equity</h3><p>Brand equity is related to&#160;the marketing power of a&#160;brand. If&#160;a brand is well received and popular, its power to&#160;generate sales and income is increased. This&#160;means the brand has strong brand equity.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Recent safety recalls have severely affected Toyota&#8217;s brand equity.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Strategy</h3><p>Brand strategy is a&#160;long-term marketing plan for a&#160;brand. All&#160;members of an organization are involved with implementing this strategy.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;To compete with Coca-Cola, a&#160;company that has existed for over 100&#160;years, Pepsi adopted a&#160;brand strategy that targets younger consumers.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Differentiation</h3><p>Differentiation is the way companies show that their brands or products are different from those of their competitors.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Some automakers are promoting technology as a&#160;differentiation strategy.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Market Segment</h3><p>A market segment is a&#160;group of customers that tends to&#160;share values, needs, and purchasing habits. Companies often direct their advertising toward particular market segments.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Teenagers are one of the main market segments for Virgin Megastores.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Positioning</h3><p>Positioning is the &#8220;place&#8221; a&#160;brand holds in the consumer&#8217;s view, in comparison to&#160;other brands.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The core concept behind Volvo&#8217;s positioning is &#8220;safety.&#8221;&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Loyalty</h3><p>When customers consistently choose one brand over another, they are showing brand loyalty.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Some automakers are rewarding brand loyalty by offering discounts to&#160;repeat customers.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Rebranding</h3><p>Rebranding is the process of updating or changing a&#160;brand to&#160;make it more appealing to&#160;its target audience.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was originally branded as a&#160;sporting goods company, but in the late 1980s, they rebranded as a&#160;luxury apparel retailer.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Niche Marketing</h3><p>Niche marketing is focused on a&#160;small portion of a&#160;market segment. So, while the market for automobiles is huge, the luxury market for 4wheel drive vehicles is considered a&#160;niche market as it is relatively&#160;small.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Mont Blanc use niche marketing techniques to&#160;reach left-handed consumers.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Co-branding</h3><p>Co-branding is when two or more companies join together and use their brands to&#160;promote one product.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;For the Barbie doll&#8217;s 50th anniversary, Mattel and Fiat co-branded to&#160;produce the Barbie 500, a&#160;pink toy car.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Brand Stretching</h3><p>Like elastic, a&#160;brand can be stretched. When&#160;new, sometimes unrelated, products are added to&#160;a&#160;brand, this is brand stretching.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Over time, Yamaha has stretched its brand from musical instruments, to&#160;motorcycles, to&#160;sports equipment.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Market Leader</h3><p>A market leader is a&#160;company or brand that has the largest percentage of sales and revenues.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Our goal is to&#160;become the market leader in tennis equipment.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Practice</h3><p>Now it&#8217;s your turn to&#160;practice. For&#160;example, if you hear:</p><p><span class="italic">We don&#8217;t have many stores in Asia, so we have little brand &lt;beep&gt; there.</span></p><p>You can say:</p><p><span class="italic">We don&#8217;t have many stores in Asia, so we have little brand awareness there.</span></p><h4>Question 1</h4><p><span class="italic">Taco Bell uses a&#160;picture of a&#160;bell in its &lt;beep&gt;.</span></p><h4>Answer 1</h4><p><span class="italic">Taco Bell uses a&#160;picture of a&#160;bell in its logo.</span></p><h4>Question 2</h4><p><span class="italic">We learned a&#160;lot about our customers&#8217; tastes from focus &lt;beep&gt;.</span></p><h4>Answer 2</h4><p><span class="italic">We learned a&#160;lot about our customers&#8217; tastes from focus groups.</span></p><h4>Question 3</h4><p><span class="italic">One of our target &lt;beep&gt; is men over age 65.</span></p><h4>Answer 3</h4><p><span class="italic">One of our target demographics is men over age 65.</span></p><h4>Question 4</h4><p><span class="italic">We&#8217;re going to&#160;test our brand &lt;beep&gt; among college students.</span></p><h4>Answer 4</h4><p><span class="italic">We&#8217;re going to&#160;test our brand recognition among college students.</span></p><h4>Question 5</h4><p><span class="italic">To build our sales among tall businesswomen, we need to&#160;try&lt;beep&gt; marketing.</span></p><h4>Answer 5</h4><p><span class="italic">To build our sales among tall businesswomen, we need to&#160;try niche marketing.</span></p><h4>Question 6</h4><p><span class="italic">My sister always buys Honda cars. She&#8217;s showing brand &lt;beep&gt;.</span></p><h4>Answer 6</h4><p><span class="italic">My sister always buys Honda cars. She&#8217;s showing brand loyalty.</span></p><h4>Question 7</h4><p><span class="italic">Our excellent reputation for quality adds to&#160;our brand &lt;beep&gt;.</span></p><h4>Answer 7</h4><p><span class="italic">Our excellent reputation for quality adds to&#160;our brand equity.</span></p><h4>Question 8</h4><p><span class="italic">Business travelers are our largest market &lt;beep&gt;.</span></p><h4>Answer 8</h4><p><span class="italic">Business travelers are our largest market segment.</span></p></div>

Whenever we make a&#160;contract we are creating a&#160;legal relationship.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Under John&#8217;s employment contract he gets three weeks of vacation every year&#8217;</span></p><h3>Intent</h3><p>Having the intent to&#160;make a&#160;contract means that you actually want to&#160;make one. Without intent from both sides, there can be no contract.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;While Tabitha wanted to&#160;make some sort of deal Ron had no intent.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Offer</h3><p>When you propose a&#160;contract you are making an offer. That&#160;offer way be accepted, rejected, or amended and sent back as a&#160;counter&#160;offer.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The company lawyers sent the offer to&#160;the competitor&#8217;s legal team.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Consideration</h3><p>Every contract must include something of value for both&#160;sides.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Pen felt that the deal didn&#8217;t include enough consideration for his party&#8217;</span></p><h3>Acceptance</h3><p>Acceptance happens when both sides agree on a&#160;contract. When&#160;the offer or contract is formally accepted, the agreement becomes&#160;legal.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Acceptance of a&#160;contract depends on certain facts being verified.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Party</h3><p>The parties in a&#160;contract are those who are agreeing to&#160;do something. Each&#160;party may be a&#160;person, a&#160;group of people, a&#160;business, or another type of organization.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Because the two parties couldn&#8217;t agree on costs, they failed to&#160;wake a&#160;deal.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Representation</h3><p>Any time you make a&#160;statement of fact in a&#160;contract you are making a&#160;representation.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The judge decided that Answer&#8217;s representations were truthful and accurate.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Repudiation</h3><p>If one party does not fulfill its obligations under a&#160;contract the result is repudiation of the contract. Repudiation may have consequences outlined in the contract or it may lead to&#160;a&#160;lawsuit.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Repeated failure to&#160;paying time led to&#160;repudiation of the contract.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Frustration</h3><p>Frustration happens when the contract cannot be fulfilled for reasons beyond anyone&#8217;s control. Frustration is not the fault of either&#160;party.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Frustration of the contract came about when it was found to&#160;violate trade agreements.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Settle a&#160;dispute</h3><p>When contracted parties can&#8217;t agree, they have a&#160;dispute. Finding a&#160;solution to&#160;their disagreement is referred to&#160;as settling the dispute.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;It took the U.S. and Canada years to&#160;settle their dispute over tobacco taxes.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Arbitration</h3><p>Contracted parties that have a&#160;disagreement will usually try to&#160;reach a&#160;solution out of court through arbitration.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Wanting to&#160;avoid a&#160;costly legal battle, the two companies agreed to&#160;arbitration.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Damages</h3><p>If the contracted parties can&#8217;t settle their dispute through arbitration, they would go to&#160;court. In&#160;this case, a&#160;judge may award damages to&#160;the party that is able to&#160;prove their&#160;claim.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The judge awarded damages to&#160;the complainant after a&#160;lengthy court case.&#8217;</span></p></div>

Parties may be joint and severally liable or they may enjoy limited liability. A&#160;contract may also include exclusion clauses to&#160;remove a&#160;party from legal responsibility in certain circumstances.</p><h3>Terms</h3><p>The terms of a&#160;contract are the detailed points that the parties are agreeing&#160;to.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;After a&#160;lengthy negotiation process, we finally came to&#160;terms on a&#160;deal.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Ratify</h3><p>When the parties agree to&#160;a&#160;contract they must ratify the agreement. This&#160;normally means officially accepting the contract by signing a&#160;paper version.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The signatures of both parties are required to&#160;ratify the agreement.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Without prejudice</h3><p>Sometimes parties will state things that they do not want to&#160;be part of the agreement. We&#160;can say that these statements are made without prejudice, and they cannot be used as evidence in legal&#160;cases.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The statement was made without prejudice, so It could not be used in court.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Legally binding</h3><p>If a&#160;contract is legally binding, it means it is valid under the law. The&#160;parties are bound to&#160;the contract and must fulfill their obligations.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The contract was not legally binding because it wasn&#8217;t signed by both parties.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Express terms</h3><p>Conditions, obligations and other points stated directly in a&#160;contract are called express&#160;terms.</p><h3>Implied terms</h3><p>Sometimes a&#160;contract includes terms that are not expressed directly in written form. These are implied terms, and they are usually more difficult to&#160;define than express&#160;terms.</p><h3>Conditions</h3><p>If a&#160;condition is not met the contract is broken, or &#8220;breached.&#8221;</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The lawyer worded the conditions of the contract very carefully.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Warranties</h3><p>Warranties are less important terms of a&#160;contract.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Breaking a&#160;warranty does not normally mean the contract has been breached.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Clauses</h3><p>The terms of a&#160;contract are written in sections, called clauses. There are certain types of clauses, such as exemption clauses and non-compete clauses.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;I read each and every clause of my employment contract very carefully.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Liability</h3><p>If a&#160;party breaks a&#160;contract or does not fulfill Its duties, that party is liable.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The judge decided liability rested with the supplier because they failed to&#160;deliver.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Joint &amp; severally liable</h3><p>If more than one person or business enters a&#160;contract as partners, they would be joint and severally liable. This&#160;means that each person or business is individually responsible for the entire contract.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;Because the contractors were joint and severally liable, they all had to&#160;pay.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Limited liability</h3><p>If one party in a&#160;contract is a&#160;limited company then that company&#8217;s owners enjoy limited liability.</p><p><span class="italic">Example: &#8216;The company enjoyed limited liability, so its directors&#8217; assets were protected.&#8217;</span></p><h3>Exclusion clause</h3><p>A party&#8217;s liability may be limited in certain situations by exclusion clauses.
